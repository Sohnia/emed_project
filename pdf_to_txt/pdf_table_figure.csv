Shown are data for 455 patients assigned to baloxavir and 230 assigned to  placebo (intention-to -treat infec ted population; 1 patient in each group did  not have data that could be evaluated). The median time to alleviation of  symptoms was 26.5 hours shor ter in the baloxavir group (53.7 hours; 95%  CI, 49.5 to 58.5) than in the placebo group (80.2 hours; 95% CI, 72.6 to  87.1) (P<0.001). Data from patients who did not have alleviation of symp - toms were censored (tick marks) at the last obser vation time point . ",

over Time in the Phase 3 Trial. Panel A shows the change from baseline (dashed line) in inf luenza infec- tious viral load over time in the baloxavir group (427 patients) and placebo  group (210 patients). The mean (±SD) viral loads on day 1 (before the initi- ation of the trial regimen) were 5.79±1.87 and 5.56±1.89 log10 50% tissue - culture infec tive dose (TCID50) per milliliter in the baloxavir and placebo  groups, respec tively. Asterisks indicate a P value of less than 0.05 for the  comparison with placebo. Panel B shows the change from baseline in inf lu- enza infec tious viral load in adults 20 to 64 years of age in the baloxavir  group (352 patients) and oseltamivir group (359 patients). The mean (±SD)  viral loads on day 1 were 5.76±1.90 and 5.94±1.69 log10 TCID50 per milliliter  in the baloxavir and oseltamivir groups, respec tively. Asterisks indicate a   P value of less than 0.05 for the comparison with oseltamivir. In both pan- els, I bars indicate standard deviations. ",
