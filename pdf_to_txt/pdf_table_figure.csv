Patients were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (ACP group), atezolizumab plus bevacizumab  plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (ABCP group), or bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (BCP group); treatments were administered  ever y 3 weeks for four or six cycles, af ter which the patients received maintenance therapy with atezolizumab, bevacizumab, or both. One  patient who was randomly assigned to the ABCP group did not receive bevacizumab and was assigned to the ACP group in the safet y  analysis. The W T population comprised patients in the intention‑to ‑treat (IT T ) population who had a wild‑t ype (W T ) genot ype (patients  with EGFR or ALK genetic alterations were excluded); the Tef f‑high W T population comprised patients in the W T population who had  high expression of an ef fec tor T‑cell (Tef f ) gene signature in the tumor. This f igure shows the ef f icacy and safet y populations as of the  data‑cutof f date of September 15, 2017. ",

Panel A shows the Kaplan–Meier estimates of progression‑free sur vival among the patients in the W T population. Panel B shows the  hazard ratios (with 95% conf idence inter vals) for investigator‑assessed progression‑free sur vival in biomarker subgroups. Stratif ied haz‑ ard ratios are given for the IT T population (all enrolled patients, including those with EGFR or ALK genetic alterations), the W T popula‑ tion, and the Tef f‑high W T population; unstratif ied hazard ratios are given for the patients with EGFR or ALK genetic alterations, all pro ‑ grammed death ligand 1 (PD ‑L1) subgroups, and the subgroup of patients with low Tef f gene‑signature expression. The PD ‑L1 subgroups  comprised 692 patients, and the Tef f subgroups 658 patients; PD ‑L1 status and Tef f gene ‑signature expression were evaluated among  the patients in the W T population. PD ‑L1 status was determined by immunohistochemical analysis: TC3 or IC3 indicates PD ‑L1 expres‑ sion on at least 50% of tumor cells or at least 10% of tumor‑inf iltrating immune cells (high PD ‑L1 expression); TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3, PD ‑L1  expression on at least 1% of tumor cells or tumor‑inf iltrating immune cells (PD ‑L1–positive); TC1/2 or IC1/2, PD ‑L1 expression on at  least 1% of tumor cells or tumor‑inf iltrating immune cells and less than 50% of tumor cells or less than 10% of tumor‑inf iltrating immune  cells (low PD ‑L1 expression); TC0/1/2 and IC0/1/2, PD ‑L1 expression on less than 50% of tumor cells and less than 10% of tumor‑inf il‑ trating immune cells (low or negative PD ‑L1 expression); and TC0 and IC0, PD ‑L1 expression on less than 1% of tumor cells and tumor‑ inf iltrating immune cells (PD ‑L1–negative). Patients with a sensitizing EGFR mutation or ALK translocation were included in the study   if they had had disease progression or the occurrence of unacceptable side ef fec ts with at least one approved targeted therapy.

At the earlier cutof f date of September 15, 2017, four patients were initially repor ted as having an EGFR mutation or an ALK trans‑ location and were later conf irmed to have W T genot ype; this has been correc ted in the analysis with the data cutof f at Januar y 22, 2018.
