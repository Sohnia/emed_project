BACKGROUND
Most patients with locally advanced, unresectable, non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  have disease progression despite def init ive chemoradiotherapy (chemotherapy plus  concurrent radiat ion therapy). This phase 3 study compared the ant i–programmed  death ligand 1 antibody durvalumab as consolidation therapy with placebo in patients  with stage III NSCLC who did not have disease progression after two or more cycles  of plat inum-based chemoradiotherapy.
METHODS
We randomly assigned pat ients, in a 2:1 rat io, to receive dur valumab (at a dose of  10 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or placebo ever y 2 weeks for up  to 12 months. The study drug was administered 1 to 42 days after the pat ients had  received chemoradiotherapy. The coprimary end points were progression-free survival  (as assessed by means of blinded independent central review) and overall survival  (unplanned for the interim analysis). Secondar y end points included 12-month and  18-month progression-free sur vival rates, the object ive response rate, the durat ion  of response, the t ime to death or distant metastasis, and safet y.
RESULTS
Of 713 pat ients who underwent randomizat ion, 709 received consolidat ion therapy  (473 received dur valumab and 236 received placebo). The median progression-free  survival from randomization was 16.8 months (95% conf idence interval [CI], 13.0 to  18.1) with durvalumab versus 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 7.8) with placebo (stratif ied  hazard rat io for disease progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.65; P<0.001);  the 12-month progression-free survival rate was 55.9% versus 35.3%, and the 18-month  progression-free survival rate was 44.2% versus 27.0%. The response rate was higher  with durvalumab than with placebo (28.4% vs. 16.0%; P<0.001), and the median dura- tion of response was longer (72.8% vs. 46.8% of the patients had an ongoing response  at 18 months). The median t ime to death or distant metastasis was longer with  durvalumab than with placebo (23.2 months vs. 14.6 months; P<0.001). Grade 3 or  4 adverse events occurred in 29.9% of the pat ients who received dur valumab and  26.1% of those who received placebo; the most common adverse event of grade 3  or 4 was pneumonia (4.4% and 3.8%, respect ively). A total of 15.4% of pat ients in  the dur valumab group and 9.8% of those in the placebo group discont inued the  study drug because of adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS
Progression-free survival was signif icantly longer with durvalumab than with placebo.  The secondary end points also favored durvalumab, and safety was similar between  the groups. (Funded by AstraZeneca; PACIFIC ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02125461.)

A pproximately one third of patients  with non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  have stage III, locally advanced disease at  diagnosis.1 The standard of care for patients with  a good performance status and unresectable stage  III NSCLC is platinum-based doublet chemother- apy concurrent with radiotherapy (chemoradio- therapy).2 However, the median progression-free  survival among patients who have received chemo- radiotherapy is poor (approximately 8 months),  and only 15% of pat ients are alive at 5 years.1,3  No major advances in the treatment for pat ients  in this context have been made in many years.3-14 Dur valumab is a select ive, high-af f init y, hu- man IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks pro- grammed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) binding to  programmed death 1 (PD-1) and CD80, allowing  T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells.15-17 An  early-phase clinical study involving mult iple ad- vanced solid tumors, including stage IIIB or IV  NSCLC,18 showed that dur valumab had encour- aging ant itumor act ivit y, and this agent was re- cent ly approved in the United States for pat ients  with locally advanced or metastat ic urothelial  carcinoma who had received platinum-based che- motherapy.19 Given preclinical evidence suggesting  that chemotherapy and radiotherapy may up-reg- ulate PD-L1 expression in tumor cells,20-22 which  is a predict ive factor for a response to dur va lu- mab, we hypothesized that dur va lumab would  provide clinical benef it after chemoradiotherapy. We report results from an interim analysis of  the randomized, double-blind, international, phase  3 PACIFIC study comparing dur valumab as con- solidat ion therapy with placebo in pat ients with  stage III, locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC  that had not progressed after plat inum-based  chemoradiotherapy.
M e t h od s
Patients
Eligible pat ients had histologically or cytologi- cally documented stage III, locally advanced, un- resectable NSCLC according to the Staging Manual  in Thoracic Oncology, version 7, of the Internat ional  Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.23 These  patients had received two or more cycles (def ined  according to local pract ice) of plat inum-based  chemotherapy (containing etoposide, vinblastine,  vinorelbine, a taxane [paclitaxel or docetaxel], or  pemetrexed) concurrent ly with def init ive radia-
t ion therapy (54 to 66 Gy), in which the mean  dose to the lung was less than 20 Gy, the V20 (the  volume of lung parenchyma that received 20 Gy  or more) was less than 35%, or both. Addit ional  inclusion criteria were no disease progression  after this treatment, an age of 18 years or older,  a World Health Organizat ion performance sta- tus of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale in which higher  numbers indicate greater disabilit y), an est i- mated life expectancy of 12 weeks or longer, and  complet ion of the last radiat ion dose within 1 to  14 days before randomizat ion (after a protocol  amendment, this criterion was changed to 1 to  42 days before randomizat ion). Key exclusion criteria were previous exposure  to ant i–PD-1 or PD-L1 ant ibodies; receipt of im- munotherapy or an invest igat iona l drug within  4 weeks before the f irst dose (6 weeks for mono- clonal antibodies); active or previous autoimmune  disease (within the past 2 years) or a histor y of  primar y immunodef iciency; evidence of uncon- trolled, concurrent illness or ongoing or act ive  infect ions; unresolved toxic ef fects of grade 2 or  higher (according to the Common Terminolog y  Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]); and grade  2 or higher pneumonit is from previous chemo- radiotherapy. Complete eligibility criteria are pro- vided in the protocol, available with the full text  of this art icle at NEJM.org.
S tudy Design and Treatments
Pat ients were randomly assigned within 1 to 42  days after chemoradiotherapy in a 2:1 rat io to  receive dur valumab at a dose of 10 mg per kilo- gram of body weight intravenously or matching  placebo ever y 2 weeks as consolidat ion therapy  for up to 12 months. Pat ients were strat if ied ac- cording to age (<65 vs. ≥65 years), sex, and smok- ing history (current or former smoker vs. never  smoked). Administrat ion of the study drug commenced  after randomizat ion on day 1, once the pat ient  was conf irmed to be eligible to part icipate. The  study drug was discont inued if there was con- f irmed disease progression, init iat ion of alterna- tive anticancer therapy, unacceptable toxic effects,  or withdrawal of consent. Pat ients could receive  the study drug unt il disease progression (unless  they had rapid tumor progression or symptom- at ic progression requiring urgent inter vent ion)  and could receive the drug again if disease con- trol had been achieved at the end of the 12

months but the disease had progressed during  follow-up.
End Points and Assessments
The coprimar y end points were progression-free  sur vival (according to the Response Evaluat ion  Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST], version 1.1, as  assessed by means of blinded independent central  review) and overall survival. Progression-free sur- vival was def ined as the time from randomization  (which occurred up to 6 weeks after chemoradio- therapy) to the date of the f irst documented event  of tumor progression or death in the absence of  disease progression. Overall survival was def ined  as the time from randomization until death from  any cause. Progression-free survival was assessed  by the investigators, according to RECIST, version  1.1, as a predef ined sensitivity analysis. The secondar y end points were the percent- age of pat ients who were alive without disease  progression at 12 and 18 months, the object ive  response rate, the durat ion of response, and the  t ime to death or distant metastasis (all assessed  by means of blinded independent central review);  and overall survival at 24 months, the safety and  side-ef fect prof ile (graded with the use of the  CTCAE, version 4.03), health-related quality of life,  pharmacokinetic characteristics, and immunoge- nicity. Eff icacy was assessed every 8 weeks for the  f irst 12 months and every 12 weeks thereafter. All  reported ef f icacy end points are for dur valumab  or placebo only (i.e., they were not aggregate end  points that included previous chemoradiotherapy). Pat ients provided opt ional archived tumor- t issue samples for PD-L1 test ing. However, en- rollment was not restricted to any thresholds for  the level of PD-L1 expression.
S tudy Oversight
The study was designed by representat ives of the  sponsor (AstraZeneca) and academic advisors. All  pat ients provided written informed consent for  participation. The study protocol and amendments  were approved by relevant ethics commit tees,  and the study was performed in accordance with  the Internat ional Conference on Harmonisat ion  Guidelines on Good Clinical Pract ice and the  Declarat ion of Helsinki. All the invest igators  (listed in the Supplementar y Appendix, available  at NEJM.org) were responsible for the collect ion  of data. Data analyses were completed by the  sponsor. The authors had full access to the data 
and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of  the data and analyses and for the f idelit y of the  study to the protocol. The authors signed a conf identiality agreement  with the sponsor. All the authors participated in  writ ing the manuscript and provided approval to  submit the manuscript for publicat ion. Medical- writ ing support, including development of the  init ial draft of the manuscript, was funded by  the sponsor.
S tatis tic al Analysis
The study was to be considered posit ive if either  of the two coprimar y end points, progression- free or overall sur vival, was signif icant ly longer  with dur valumab than with placebo. Approxi- mately 702 pat ients were needed for 2:1 random- izat ion to obtain 458 progression-free sur vival  events for the primar y analysis of progression- free sur vival and 491 overall sur vival events for  the primar y analysis of overall survival. It was  est imated that the study would have a 95% or  greater power to detect a hazard rat io for disease  progression or death of 0.67 and a 85% or  greater power to detect a hazard rat io for death  of 0.73, on the basis of a log-rank test with a  two-sided signif icance level of 2.5% for each  coprimar y end point. An interim analysis of progression-free sur- vival was planned when approximately 367  events had occurred. At this interim analysis,  the hazard rat io for disease progression or death  was est imated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier  method. Between-group comparisons were per- formed with the use of the log-rank test, strat i- f ied according to age, sex, and smoking histor y.  Sensit ivit y analyses included assessment of eval- uat ion bias, evaluat ion-t ime bias, and attrit ion  bias in the determinat ion of disease progression  and adjustment for various covariates in the es- t imat ion of the hazard rat io for disease progres- sion or death. A preplanned analysis of progression-free  sur vival in 35 prespecif ied subgroups was per- formed in which hazard rat ios and 95% conf i- dence inter vals were calculated with the use of  an unstrat if ied Cox regression model. There was  no mult iplicit y adjustment because the subgroup  analysis was intended to show consistency of the  treatment ef fect. Response rates were est imated with the use  of the Clopper–Pearson method and compared

with the use of Fisher’s exact test. Type I error  was controlled for the coprimar y end points (as  described in the Supplementar y Appendix) and  the key secondary end point (the objective response  rate), but not for other secondary end points. Eff i- cacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat popula- t ion, and safet y was assessed in the as-t reated  populat ion. In an ongoing analysis, an external independent  data and safety monitoring committee is assessing  safet y. This committee assessed the interim ef- f icacy analyses.

Patients and Treatment
Between May 2014 and April 2016, a total of 709  of 713 pat ients who underwent randomizat ion  (99.4%) received at least 1 dose of study drug as  consolidat ion therapy (473 pat ients received dur- valumab and 236 received placebo) (Fig. S1 in  the Supplementar y Appendix). Baseline charac- terist ics were well balanced in the two groups  (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supplementar y  Appendix). The median age of all pat ients was  64 years, and the majorit y were men (70.1%) and  current or former smokers (91.0%); 45.7% had a  squamous histologic t ype of tumor. The previ- ous use of chemotherapy was also well balanced  between the two groups (Table S2 in the Supple- mentar y Appendix); in addit ion, 25.8% of the  pat ients in the dur valumab group and 28.7% of  those in the placebo group had received induc- t ion chemotherapy before def init ive chemoradio- therapy. The response to previous chemoradio- therapy was similar in the two groups (complete  response, 1.9% in the dur valumab group and  3.0% in the placebo group; part ial response,  48.7% and 46.8%, respect ively). According to the assessment of archived tu- mor samples obtained before chemoradiothera- py, PD-L1 expression of 25% or more on tumor  cells occurred in 22.3% of pat ients (24.2% in the  dur valumab group and 18.6% in the placebo  group) and PD-L1 expression of less than 25%  on tumor cells occurred in 41.0% of the pat ients  (39.3% in the dur valumab group and 44.3% in  the placebo group); 36.7% of the pat ients in  both groups had unknown PD-L1 status (Table  S3 in the Supplementar y Appendix). EGFR muta- t ions were obser ved in 6.0% of the pat ients  (6.1% in the dur valumab group and 5.9% in the 
placebo group), whereas 67.3% of the pat ients’  tumors were EGFR-negat ive or wild-t ype (66.2%  in the dur valumab group and 69.6% in the pla- cebo group). The EGFR mutat ion status was un- known in 27.7% of the patients in the durvalumab  group and 24.5% of the patients in the placebo  group (Table S3 in the Supplementar y Appen- dix). No signif icant (P<0.05) between-group dif- ferences were noted in either PD-L1 expression  or EGFR mutat ion status. As of Februar y 13, 2017 (the data cutof f point  for this interim analysis), 371 pat ients had dis- ease progression (214 in the dur valumab group  and 157 in the placebo group). The overall me- dian follow-up was 14.5 months (range, 0.2 to  29.9). The median number of infusions received  was 20 (range, 1 to 27) in the dur valumab group  and 14 (range, 1 to 26) in the placebo group;  6.3% and 5.1% of the pat ients, respect ively, were  st ill receiving the study drug at the data cutof f  point (Table S4 in the Supplementar y Appendix).  The median relat ive dose intensit y was 100% in  each group (range, 29 to 100 in the dur valumab  group and 50 to 100 in the placebo group). Se- rum trough concentrat ions of dur valumab were  similar at weeks 24 and 48 (177.00 and 189.00 μg  per milliliter, respect ively) (Table S5 in the Sup- plementar y Appendix).
Effic acy
Median progression-free sur vival from random- izat ion, as assessed by means of blinded inde- pendent central review, was 16.8 months (95%  conf idence inter val [CI], 13.0 to 18.1) with dur- valumab versus 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 7.8)  with placebo (strat if ied hazard rat io for disease  progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.65;  two-sided P<0.001) (Fig. 1). The 12-month pro- gression-free survival rate was 55.9% (95% CI,  51.0 to 60.4) with dur valumab and 35.3% (95%  CI, 29.0 to 41.7) with placebo, and the 18-month  progression-free survival rate was 44.2% (95% CI,  37.7 to 50.5) and 27.0% (95% CI, 19.9 to 34.5),  respectively. Progression-free survival results were  consistent across all prespecif ied sensitivity analy- ses (data not shown), including results determined  by investigator assessment (stratif ied hazard ratio,  0.61; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.76; two-sided P<0.001). A progression-free sur vival benef it with dur- valumab was consistent ly observed across all  prespecif ied subgroups, as def ined according to  patient demographic characteristics, baseline clini-

copathologic features, and response to previous  treatment (Fig. 2). Addit ional nonprognost ic fac- tors are listed in Figure S2 in the Supplementar y  Appendix. Notably, the progression-free sur vival  benef it with dur valumab was obser ved irrespec- tive of PD-L1 expression before chemoradiothera- py (hazard rat io, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.82] for  a PD-L1 expression level of <25% and 0.41 [95%  CI, 0.26 to 0.65] for a PD-L1 expression level of  ≥25%). A progression-free sur vival benef it was  also evident in pat ients who had never smoked.  The absence of correct ions for mult iple com- parisons limits the extrapolat ions to part icular  subgroups. The median t ime to death or distant metasta- sis was 23.2 months (95% CI, 23.2 to not reached)  with durvalumab versus 14.6 months (95% CI,  10.6 to 18.6) with placebo (hazard rat io, 0.52;  95% CI, 0.39 to 0.69; two-sided P<0.001) (Fig. S3  in the Supplementar y Appendix). In addit ion, the  frequency of new lesions, as assessed by means  of blinded independent central review, was 20.4%  with dur valumab and 32.1% with placebo, with  a lower incidence of new brain metastases with 
dur valumab (5.5% vs. 11.0%) (Table S6 in the  Supplementar y Appendix). The object ive response rate, as assessed by  means of blinded independent central review,  was signif icant ly higher with dur valumab than  with placebo (28.4% vs. 16.0%; P<0.001) (Ta- ble 2); 16.5% of pat ients who received dur va lu- mab and 27.7% of those who received placebo had  disease progression (Table 2). The median dura- t ion of response was longer with dur va lumab  than with placebo (Table 2, and Fig. S4 in the  Supplementary Appendix). Of the pat ients who  had a response to dur valumab, 72.8% had an  ongoing response at both 12 and 18 months as  compared with 56.1% and 46.8%, respect ively, of  patients in the placebo group who had an ongoing  response (Table 2). An analysis of overall survival  was not planned at the time of this interim analy- sis of progression-free sur vival.

Figure 2 . Subgroup Analysis of Prognostic Fac tors for Progression-free Survival in the Intention-to -Treat Population. Progression-free sur vival was def ined according to RECIST, version 1.1, and assessed by means of blinded independent central review.  The hazard ratio and 95% conf idence inter val were not calculated for the complete response because this subgroup had less than 20  events. EGFR denotes epidermal grow th fac tor receptor, and PD -L1 programmed death ligand 1.
(Table 3); grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred  in 29.9% and 26.1%, respect ively. The most com- mon grade 3 or 4 adverse event was pneumonia  (in 4.4% of pat ients in the dur valumab group  and 3.8% of pat ients in the placebo group). Dis- cont inuat ion due to adverse events occurred in  15.4% of pat ients in the dur valumab group and  9.8% of pat ients in the placebo group, and seri- ous adverse events occurred in 28.6% and 22.6%,  respect ively (Table S7 in the Supplementar y Ap- pendix). Death due to adverse events occurred in  4.4% of pat ients in the dur valumab group and  5.6% of pat ients in the placebo group (Table 3).  Treatment-related adverse events are summarized  in Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix. The most frequent adverse events leading to  discont inuat ion of dur valumab and placebo were  pneumonit is or radiat ion pneumonit is (in 6.3%  and 4.3%, respect ively) and pneumonia (in 1.1%  and 1.3%). In pat ients who received dur valumab,  as compared with those who received placebo, 
pneumonit is or radiat ion pneumonit is of any  grade occurred in 33.9% and 24.8% and pneu- monit is or radiat ion pneumonit is of grade 3 or  4 occurred in 3.4% and 2.6%; pneumonia of any  grade occurred in 13.1% and 7.7%, and pneumo- nia of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 4.4% and 3.8%. Adverse events of any grade that were of spe- cial interest, regardless of cause, were reported  in 66.1% of pat ients in the dur valumab group  and 48.7% of pat ients in the placebo group. The  majorit y were grade 1 or 2, and events of grade  3 or higher were infrequent (in <10% of pat ients)  in both groups. The most frequent adverse events  of any grade that were of special interest with  durvalumab versus placebo were diarrhea (18.3%  and 18.8%), pneumonitis (12.6% and 7.7%), rash  (12.2% and 7.3%), and pruritus (12.2% and 4.7%).  Adverse events of special interest for which pa- t ients received concomitant treatment were re- ported in 42.1% and 17.1% of patients, respectively;  treatments included glucocorticoids (in 15.2% and

*  The tumor response was assessed by means of blinded independent central review. NR denotes not reached. †  The analysis was performed with data from patients with measurable disease at baseline as determined by either of the  two independent central reviewers. ‡  The relative risk (95% CI) is shown for the objective response rate, and the hazard ratio (95% CI) is shown for the duration  of response. Placebo was the reference group when relative risk and hazard ratio were calculated; therefore, a relative  risk greater than 1 is in favor of durvalumab and a hazard ratio less than 1 is in favor of durvalumab. §  One patient could not be included in any of the best-overall-response categories because of inconsistency in the base- line assessment for measurable disease between the two independent central reviewers. ¶  Percentages were calculated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method.

Immune-mediated adverse events of any grade,  regardless of cause, were reported in 24.2% of  pat ients in the dur valumab group and 8.1% of  pat ients in the placebo group; grade 3 or 4 im- mune-mediated adverse events were reported in  3.4% and 2.6% of pat ients, respect ively (Table S9  in the Supplementar y Appendix). Treatments for  immune-mediated adverse events included sys- temic glucocorticoids (in 14.3% of patients in the  durvalumab group and 5.6% in the placebo group),  high-dose glucocort icoids (8.2% and 4.3%), en- docrine therapy (10.7% and 1.3%), and other im- munosuppressive agents (0.4% of both groups).

In the planned interim analysis of the PACIFIC  study, the coprimar y end point of progression-
free survival was met. Among patients with locally  advanced, unresectable NSCLC, progression-free  sur vival was 11 months longer among pat ients  who received dur valumab than among those  who received placebo (hazard rat io for disease  progression or death, 0.52; P<0.001). The longer  progression-free sur vival was accomplished in a  biomarker-independent population. Patients with  a level of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells of less  than 25% accounted for a larger proport ion of  participants in this study than patients with 25%  or greater PD-L1–positive tumor cells. In addition,  the dif ference in progression-free sur vival in fa- vor of dur valumab was shown across all pre- specif ied subgroups, including pat ients who  were not expected to have a response according  to the results of trials involving pat ients with  advanced or metastat ic disease. Although data on overall sur vival were im- mature at the t ime of this analysis, clinical ben- ef it with dur valumab was evident by improve-

ment in all secondar y end points, such as an  object ive response rate that was higher by 12.4  percentage points with dur valumab than with  placebo (P<0.001). In addit ion, responses with  dur valumab were durable as compared with pla- cebo (72.8% of pat ients who had a response to  dur valumab had an ongoing response at both 12  and 18 months as compared with 56.1% and  46.8%, respect ively, who had a response to pla- cebo). Dur valumab also had a favorable ef fect on  the frequency of new metastases, including a  lower incidence of new brain metastases.
The safet y prof ile of dur valumab in this  populat ion was consistent with that of other im- munotherapies and with its known safet y prof ile  as monotherapy in pat ients with more advanced  disease (stage IIIB or IV NSCLC).18 Although the  incidences of some adverse events of any cause,  including pneumonit is or radiat ion pneumoni- t is, were increased with both dur valumab and  placebo in this study, this was expected after de- f initive chemoradiotherapy. In addition, pneumo- nit is or radiat ion pneumonit is in pat ients who  received durvalumab was mostly low grade, and

*  Included are events that were reported in at least 10% of the patients in either group. Grade 5 adverse events of any  cause occurred in 21 patients (4.4%) who received durvalumab (4 [0.8%] with pneumonitis, 2 [0.4%] with cardiac arrest,  and 1 each [0.2%] with the following: pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pneumococcal pneumonia, sepsis, septic  shock, cardiomyopathy, cardiopulmonary failure, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, dyspnea, emphysema, he- moptysis, respiratory distress, respiratory failure, radiation pneumonitis, right ventricular failure, increased level of  brain natriuretic peptide, and unknown cause). Grade 5 adverse events of any cause occurred in 13 patients (5.6%)  who received placebo (3 each [1.3%] with pneumonitis and pneumonia and 1 each [0.4%] with the following: pneumo- nia streptococcal, West Nile virus infection, cardiac arrest, eosinophilic myocarditis, hemoptysis, intestinal obstruc- tions, radiation pneumonitis, and unknown cause). Each patient could have had more than one grade 5 adverse event. †  Pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis was assessed by investigators with subsequent review and adjudication by the  study sponsor. In addition, pneumonitis is a grouped term that includes acute interstitial pneumonitis, interstitial lung  disease, pneumonitis, and pulmonary fibrosis.

the incidence of clinically important grade 3 or 4  events was well balanced between the groups  (3.4% in the durvalumab group and 2.6% in the  placebo group) and lower than that in other stud- ies in the same disease context.6,24 Taken togeth- er, these data suggest that durvalumab has man- ageable side effects after chemoradiotherapy. In conclusion, in the PACIFIC study, one of the  coprimar y end points was met at this planned  interim analysis, and this study showed a signif i- cant increase in progression-free survival and no  new safet y signals with dur valumab in pat ients  with stage III, unresectable NSCLC who had re- ceived chemoradiotherapy. These positive f indings  in an unselected patient population, irrespective of  baseline expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells,  suggest that dur valumab may be an ef fect ive  adjuvant therapy in pat ients with stage III dis- ease after standard treatment. Uncertaint y about  the potent ial mechanisms driving the interac- t ion between immunotherapy and chemoradio- therapy warrants further invest igat ion.
