BACKGROUND
First-line therapy for advanced non–sma ll-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that lacks  targetable mutations is platinum-based chemotherapy. Among patients with a tumor  proportion score for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) of 50% or greater, pembro- lizumab has replaced cytotoxic chemotherapy as the f irst-line treatment of choice.  The addit ion of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy resulted in signif icant ly higher  rates of response and longer progression-free sur vival than chemotherapy alone in  a phase 2 trial.
METHODS
In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) 616 patients  with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations who  had received no previous treatment for metastat ic disease to receive pemetrexed  and a plat inum-based drug plus either 200 mg of pembrolizumab or placebo ever y  3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab or placebo for up to a total of  35 cycles plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy. Crossover to pembrolizumab mono- therapy was permitted among the pat ients in the placebo-combinat ion group who  had verif ied disease progression. The primar y end points were overall survival and  progression-free survival, as assessed by blinded, independent central radiologic review.
RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 10.5 months, the est imated rate of overall sur vival at  12 months was 69.2% (95% conf idence inter val [CI], 64.1 to 73.8) in the pembro- lizumab-combinat ion group versus 49.4% (95% CI, 42.1 to 56.2) in the placebo- combinat ion group (hazard rat io for death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64; P<0.001).  Improvement in overall sur vival was seen across all PD-L1 categories that were  evaluated. Median progression-free sur vival was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 9.2) in  the pembrolizumab-combinat ion group and 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 5.5) in the  placebo-combinat ion group (hazard rat io for disease progression or death, 0.52;  95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 67.2%  of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 65.8% of those in  the placebo-combinat ion group.
CONCLUSIONS
In pat ients with previously untreated metastat ic nonsquamous NSCLC without  EGFR or ALK mutat ions, the addit ion of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy  of pemetrexed and a plat inum-based drug resulted in signif icant ly longer overall  survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone.

Inhibitors of programmed death 1 (PD-1)  and its ligand PD-L1 are effective therapies for  metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  lacking sensit izing EGFR or ALK mutat ions. Pem- brolizumab (Keytruda, Merck), nivolumab (Opdivo,  Bristol-Myers Squibb), and atezolizumab (Tecen- triq, Genentech) are approved as second-line ther- apy. Among pat ients in whom the percentage of  tumor cells with membranous PD-L1 staining  (tumor proport ion score) is 50% or greater, pem- brolizumab has replaced cytotoxic chemotherapy  as the f irst-line treatment of choice. However, pa- t ients with a tumor proport ion score of 50% or  greater represent a minority of those with NSCLC.  Because pat ients with advanced NSCLC can un- dergo rapid clinical deteriorat ion during disease  progression, less than one half of pat ients with  advanced NSCLC ever receive second-line therapy.1,2  First-line combinat ion regimens that include a  PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor may maximize the chance  of response and lead to prolonged survival. Modu- lation of the immune response through PD-1 inhi- bition may be enhanced by the potential immuno- genic ef fects of cytotoxic chemotherapy, such as  increasing the potential for antigen cross-presen- tation by dendrit ic cells after the destruct ion of  tumor cells,3 inhibit ing myeloid-derived suppres- sor cells,4 increasing the rat io of cytotoxic lym- phocytes to regulator y T cells,5 and blocking the  STAT6 pathway to enhance dendritic-cell activity.6 A randomized, phase 2 trial of carboplatin plus  pemet rexed (A limta, Eli Lilly) with or without  pembrolizumab showed signif icantly better rates  of response and longer progression-free sur vival  with the addit ion of pembrolizumab than with  chemotherapy alone.7 In the global, double-blind,  placebo-controlled, phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 trial,  we compared the combination of pemetrexed and  a platinum-based drug plus either pembrolizumab  or placebo in pat ients with nonsquamous NSCLC  with any level of PD-L1 expression.

Patients
Pat ients who were at least 18 years of age were  eligible for enrollment if they had pathologically  conf irmed metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with- out sensit izing EGFR or ALK mutat ions; had re- ceived no previous systemic therapy for metastatic  disease; had an Eastern Cooperat ive Oncolog y  Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 or  1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicat-
ing increasing disabilit y)8; had at least one mea- surable lesion according to the Response Evalu- at ion Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version  1.19; and had provided a tumor sample for deter- minat ion of PD-L1 status. Pat ients were excluded  if they had symptomat ic central ner vous system  metastases, had a histor y of noninfect ious pneu- monit is that required the use of glucocort icoids,  had act ive autoimmune disease, or were receiv- ing systemic immunosuppressive treatment. Be- cause of an increased risk of pneumonit is,10 pa- t ients were also excluded if they had received  more than 30 Gy of radiotherapy to the lung in  the previous 6 months. Full eligibilit y criteria are  listed in the trial protocol, available with the full  text of this art icle at NEJM.org.
Trial Design and Treatment
In this double-blind trial, patients were randomly  assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either 200 mg of  pembrolizumab or saline placebo, both adminis- tered intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cy- cles. Randomizat ion was performed by means of  an integrated interactive voice-response and Web- response system (i.e., treatment assignments could  be provided by following a series of prompts on  a touch-tone phone or by following the same  prompts in a Web-based portal). Randomizat ion  was strat if ied according to PD-L1 expression  (tumor proport ion score, ≥1% vs. <1%), choice of  plat inum-based drug (cisplat in vs. carboplat in),  and smoking history (never vs. former or current). All the pat ients received four cycles of the  invest igator’s choice of intravenously adminis- tered cisplat in (75 mg per square meter of body- surface area) or carboplatin (area under the con- centrat ion–t ime cur ve, 5 mg per milliliter per  minute) plus pemetrexed (500 mg per square me- ter), all administered intravenously every 3 weeks,  followed by pemetrexed (500 mg per square meter)  every 3 weeks. All the patients received premedica- t ion with folic acid, vitamin B12, and glucocort i- coids administered according to local guidelines  for pemetrexed use. Treatment was cont inued unt il radiographic  progression, unacceptable toxic effects, investiga- tor decision, or pat ient withdrawal of consent. If  toxicit y was clearly attributed to one agent, that  drug alone could be discontinued. Patients in the  placebo-combination group in whom disease pro- gression was verif ied by blinded, independent  central radiologic review were eligible to cross over  to receive pembrolizumab monotherapy.

Assessments
PD-L1 expression was assessed during screening  at a central laboratory by means of the PD-L1 IHC  22C3 pharmDx assay (Agilent) in formalin-f ixed  tumor samples obtained by core-needle or exci- sional biopsy or from tissue resected at the time  that metastatic disease was diagnosed. Expression  was categorized according to the tumor propor- t ion score (i.e., the percentage of tumor cells  with membranous PD-L1 staining).11 Investigators,  pat ients, and representat ives of the sponsor were  unaware of the patients’ tumor proportion scores.  Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were  graded according to the National Cancer Institute  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,  version 4.0. Tumor imaging was scheduled for  weeks 6 and 12, then ever y 9 weeks through  week 48 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Response  was assessed according to RECIST, version 1.1.9  Pat ients were contacted ever y 12 weeks to assess  sur vival during follow-up.
End Points
The two primary end points were overall survival  (time from randomization to death from any cause)  and progression-free survival (time from random- izat ion to disease progression, as assessed by  blinded, independent central radiologic review, or  death from any cause, whichever occurred f irst).  The secondar y end points were the response rate  (the percentage of patients with a conf irmed com- plete or partial response), the duration of response  (t ime from f irst documented complete or part ial  response to disease progression or death), and  safety. Both the response rate and the duration of  response were assessed by blinded, independent  central radiologic review. Explorator y end points  included the ef fect of PD-L1 expression on ef f i- cacy and pat ient-reported outcomes. The full list  of end points and the stat ist ical analysis plan are  available in the protocol.
Trial Oversight
The trial was designed by a panel of academic  advisors and employees of Merck (in Kenilworth,  New Jersey), the trial sponsor. An external moni- toring committee oversaw the trial and assessed  ef f icacy and safet y at prespecif ied interim analy- ses. The trial protocol and all amendments were 
approved by the appropriate ethics panel at each  center. All the patients provided written informed  consent before enrollment. Eli Lilly provided the  pemetrexed but otherwise had no role in the trial. All the authors attest that the trial was con- ducted in accordance with the protocol and all  its amendments and with Good Clinical Pract ice  standards. All the authors had access to the data  and part icipated in the writ ing or reviewing and  edit ing of the manuscript. The f irst draft of the  manuscript was written by the f irst author with  input from authors employed by the sponsor. As- sistance in the preparation of the manuscript was  provided by a medical writer employed by the  sponsor. The investigators agreed to keep all as- pects of the trial conf idential. All the authors vouch  for the accuracy and completeness of the data and  analyses.
S tatis tic al Analysis
Ef f icacy was assessed in the intent ion-to-treat  populat ion, which included all the pat ients who  had undergone randomizat ion. Safet y was as- sessed in the as-treated population, which included  a ll pat ients who had undergone randomizat ion  and received at least one dose of the assigned com- bination therapy. The Kaplan–Meier method was  used to estimate overall and progression-free sur- vival. Data for pat ients who were alive or lost to  follow-up were censored for overall sur vival at  the t ime they were last known to be alive; data  for pat ients who crossed over were not censored  at the t ime of crossover. Data for pat ients who  were alive and did not have disease progression  or who were lost to follow-up were censored for  the analysis of progression-free sur vival at the  t ime of the last imaging assessment. The strat i- f ied log-rank test was used to assess between- group dif ferences in overall and progression-free  survival. Hazard ratios and associated 95% conf i- dence inter vals were calculated with the use of a  strat if ied Cox proport ional-hazards model and  Efron’s method for handling tied events to assess  the magnitude of the treatment dif ference. Dif- ferences in response rate were assessed with the  stratif ied method of Miettinen and Nurminen. The  randomization stratif ication factors were applied  to all strat if ied ef f icacy analyses. The full stat ist ical analysis plan specif ied the  performance of two interim analyses and a f inal  analysis. The family-wise t ype I error rate was  strict ly controlled at a one-sided alpha level of  0.025 with the use of the graphical method of

Maurer and Bretz (Fig. S1 in the Supplementar y  Appendix, available at NEJM.org). If a signif icant  benef it with regard to one of the primar y end  points was found in the pembrolizumab-combina- tion group, the corresponding alpha level would  be rolled over for testing of the other primary end  point. The Lan–DeMets O’Brien–Fleming spending  funct ion was used to control the t ype I error in  the interim and f inal analyses. We determined that the trial would have a  power of 90% to show a hazard rat io for disease  progression or death of 0.70 at a one-sided alpha  level of 0.0095 (based on 468 events) and a hazard  rat io of 0.70 for death at a one-sided alpha level  of 0.0155 (based on 416 deaths) for the compari- son between the pembrolizumab-combinat ion  group and the placebo-combinat ion group. The  planned enrollment was 570 pat ients. The f irst interim analysis was to be performed  after enrollment was complete and approximately  370 events of progression or death had occurred;  it was est imated that approximately 242 deaths  would have occurred at this t ime. As of Novem- ber 8, 2017, there were 410 events of disease pro- gression or death and 235 deaths. On the basis of  the obser ved number of events, the mult iplicit y- adjusted, one-sided alpha levels at the f irst in- terim analysis were 0.00559 for progression-free  sur vival and 0.00128 for overall sur vival. Results  were reviewed by the external monitoring com- mittee on January 10, 2018. The monitoring com- mittee reported that the ef f icacy boundaries for  overall survival and progression-free survival had  been met. The trial is continuing in order to evalu- ate outcomes with addit ional follow-up. All data  reported here are based on the f irst interim  analysis.

Patients and Treatment
A total of 965 pat ients were screened for enroll- ment at 126 sites in 16 countries (Fig. S2 in the  Supplementary Appendix). Between Februar y 26,  2016, and March 6, 2017, a total of 616 pat ients  from 118 sites who had met all the eligibility crite- ria were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab- combinat ion group (410 pat ients) or the placebo- combinat ion group (206 pat ients). The baseline  demographic and disease characteristics were gen- erally well balanced between the groups, although  the percentage of men was higher in the pembro-

Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of overall sur vival  (the f irst of the two primar y end points) in the two tri- al groups (Panel A) and an analysis of overall sur vival  in key subgroups (Panel B). Patients in the pembroli- zumab -combination group received pemetrexed, a  platinum-based drug, and pembrolizumab; those in  the placebo -combination group received pemetrexed,  a platinum-based drug, and placebo.

A PD-L1 tumor proport ion score of 1%  or greater was reported in 63.0% of the pat ients,  carboplat in was the chosen plat inum-based drug  in 72.2% of the patients, and 88.1% of the patients  were current or former smokers. Of the 616 pat ients who were enrolled, 405 in  the pembrolizumab-combination group and 202 in  the placebo-combinat ion group received at least  one dose of the assigned combinat ion therapy.  With a median follow-up of 10.5 months (range,  0.2 to 20.4), the mean (±SD) duration of treatment  was 7.4±4.7 months in the pembrolizumab-com- bination group and 5.4±4.3 months in the placebo- combinat ion group. All four planned doses of  cisplat in or carboplat in were received by 82.5%  of the pat ients in the pembrolizumab-combina- t ion group and by 74.3% of those in the placebo- combinat ion group; 76.5% and 66.8%, respec- t ively, received f ive or more doses of pemetrexed.  (Table S1 in the Supplementar y Appendix shows  the exposure to treatment in patients who received  carboplatin and in those who received cisplatin.) At the time of the data cutoff in the as-treated  populat ion, 137 of 405 pat ients (33.8%) in the  pembrolizumab-combinat ion group and 36 of  202 pat ients (17.8%) in the placebo-combinat ion  group were st ill receiving the assigned treatment  (Fig. S2 in the Supplementar y Appendix). In the  intention-to-treat population, 125 of 410 patients  (30.5%) in the pembrolizumab-combination group  and 96 of 206 pat ients (46.6%) in the placebo- combination group had received at least one sub- sequent therapy either while continuing to partici- pate in the trial or outside the trial (Table S2 in

an ef fect ive crossover rate of 41.3% in the inten- tion-to-treat population and 50.0% in the 170 pa- tients who had discont inued all trial drugs. The  ef fect ive crossover rate in the intent ion-to-treat  populat ion was similar across the subgroups of  PD-L1 tumor proport ion score.
Overall Survival
With 235 deaths in the intent ion-to-treat popula- t ion, the est imated proport ion of pat ients who  were alive at 12 months was 69.2% (95% conf i- dence inter val [CI], 64.1 to 73.8) in the pembro- lizumab-combinat ion group and 49.4% (95% CI,  42.1 to 56.2) in the placebo-combinat ion group.  The median overall sur vival was not reached in  the pembrolizumab-combinat ion group and was  11.3 months (95% CI, 8.7 to 15.1) in the placebo- combinat ion group (hazard rat io for death, 0.49;  95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). The  benef it of the pembrolizumab combinat ion was  obser ved in all subgroups that were analyzed  (Fig. 1B), including those with a PD-L1 tumor pro- portion score of less than 1% (12-month overall  sur vival rate, 61.7% vs. 52.2%; hazard rat io for  death, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.92), a score of 1 to  49% (12-month overall sur vival rate, 71.5% vs.  50.9%; hazard rat io, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.90),  and a score of 50% or greater (12-month overall  survival rate, 73.0% vs. 48.1%; hazard ratio, 0.42;  95% CI, 0.26 to 0.68) (Fig. 2).
Progression -free Survival
With 410 events of progression or death, the  median progression-free sur vival was 8.8 months  (95% CI, 7.6 to 9.2) in the pembrolizumab-com- bination group and 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 5.5)  in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for  progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64;  P<0.001) (Fig. 3A). The est imated proport ion of  pat ients who were alive and progression-free at  12 months was 34.1% (95% CI, 28.8 to 39.5) in  the pembrolizumab-combination group and 17.3%  (95% CI, 12.0 to 23.5) in the placebo-combination  group. The results were similar when progression  was assessed according to invest igator review  (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The haz- ard ratio for progression-free survival was less than  1.00 across all subgroups that were analyzed  (Fig. 3B) and across all subgroups of PD-L1 tu- mor proport ion score (Fig. 4), although the up-

Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of overall sur vival  in patients with a tumor propor tion score of less than  1% (Panel A), a score of 1 to 49% (Panel B), or a score  of 50% or greater (Panel C). The greatest relative bene - f it was obser ved in the subgroup with a PD -L1 tumor  propor tion score of 50% or greater, a f inding that was  consistent with the results of previous studies. Tick  marks indicate censoring of data at the last time the  patient was known to be alive.
per boundaries of the 95% conf idence inter vals  crossed 1.00 for pat ients who were 65 years or  older (median, 9.0 months vs. 6.7 months; hazard  rat io, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.02) and those with  a PD-L1 tumor proport ion score of less than 1%  (median, 6.1 months vs. 5.1 months; hazard ratio,  0.75; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.05).
Tumor Response
The response rate as assessed by blinded, indepen- dent central radiologic review was 47.6% (95% CI,  42.6 to 52.5) in the pembrolizumab-combinat ion  group and 18.9% (95% CI, 13.8 to 25.0) in the  placebo-combination group (P<0.001). The results  were similar when the response was assessed by  investigator review (Table S3 in the Supplementary  Appendix). The disease control rate (the proportion  of pat ients with a conf irmed complete or part ial  response or stable disease) was 84.6% in the  pembrolizumab-combinat ion group and 70.4%  in the placebo-combinat ion group. The change  from baseline in the sum of the longest diame- ters of target lesions is shown in Figure S4 in the  Supplementar y Appendix. The median durat ion of response was 11.2  months (range, 1.1+ to 18.0+) in the pembrolizum- ab-combination group and 7.8 months (range, 2.1+  to 16.4+) in the placebo-combination group. (Plus  signs in the ranges indicate that there was no  progressive disease at the time of the last disease  assessment.) The response rate was higher in the  pembrolizumab-combinat ion group than in the  placebo-combination group across all categories of  PD-L1 tumor proport ion score, with the greatest  between-group difference in patients with a tumor  proport ion score of 50% or greater (61.4% vs.  22.9%) (Fig. S5 in the Supplementar y Appendix).

Adverse Events
Adverse events of any cause and regardless of at- tribution to treatment by the investigator occurred  in 99.8% of the pat ients in the pembrolizumab- combinat ion group and in 99.0% of those in the  placebo-combination group (Table 2). These events  were of grade 3 or higher in 67.2% and 65.8% of  the pat ients, respect ively. Discont inuat ion of all  trial drugs because of adverse events occurred in  13.8% of the pat ients in the pembrolizumab- combinat ion group and in 7.9% of those in the  placebo-combination group; discontinuation rates  of pembrolizumab and placebo were 20.2% and  10.4%, respectively (Table 2). The rates of adverse  events were similar in patients who received car- boplat in and cisplat in (Tables S4 and S5 in the  Supplementar y Appendix). Adverse events led to  death in 27 of 405 pat ients (6.7%) in the pem- brolizumab-combinat ion group and in 12 of 202  patients (5.9%) in the placebo-combination group. In the two groups, the most common adverse  events were nausea, anemia, and fatigue (Table 2;  exposure-adjusted rates are provided in Table S6  in the Supplementary Appendix). The only adverse  events that were reported in at least 10% of the  pat ients that were more frequent in the pembro- lizumab-combinat ion group were diarrhea and  rash (Fig. S6A in the Supplementar y Appendix).  Adverse events of grade 3 or higher that were re- ported in at least 10% of the patients in the pem- brolizumab-combinat ion group or the placebo- combination group were anemia (16.3% and 15.3%)  and neutropenia (15.8% and 11.9%) (Table 2). The  only adverse event of grade 3 or higher that was  more frequent in the pembrolizumab-combina- t ion group was febrile neutropenia (Fig. S6B in  the Supplementary Appendix). Acute kidney injury  occurred more frequently in the pembrolizumab- combinat ion group than in the placebo-combi- nat ion group (5.2% vs. 0.5%). In the pembroli- zumab-combinat ion group, acute kidney injur y  was of grade 3 or higher in 8 pat ients (2.0%) and  led to the discont inuat ion of all trial therapy in  8 patients (2.0%); at the time of this analysis, acute  kidney injury of grade 3 or lower had resolved or  was resolving in 9 of 19 pat ients. Immune-mediated adverse events, which were  def ined on the basis of a list of terms specif ied  by the sponsor and were included in the analysis  regardless of whether they were attributed to treat- ment by the invest igator, occurred in 92 of 405  pat ients (22.7%) in the pembrolizumab-combi-
nat ion group and in 24 of 202 pat ients (11.9%)  in the placebo-combination group (Table 3). These  events were of grade 3 or higher in 36 of 405 pa- tients (8.9%) and 9 of 202 patients (4.5%), respec- tively. Three immune-mediated adverse events (all  pneumonitis) led to death in the pembrolizumab- combinat ion group.
D i s c u s s i on
In this phase 3 trial, we found that adding pem- brolizumab to standard chemotherapy with peme- trexed and a platinum-based drug resulted in a risk  of the two primary end points that was approxi- mately 50% lower than the risks with standard  chemotherapy alone in pat ients with untreated,  metastat ic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensi- t izing EGFR or ALK mutat ions. Together with the  results from KEYNOTE-024,12,13 the data from  KEYNOTE-189 suggest that introducing immuno- therapy as a f irst-line therapy may have a favorable  long-term ef fect on outcomes. The sur vival benef it associated with the pem- brolizumab combination was observed in all sub- groups of PD-L1 tumor proport ion scores, in- cluding pat ients with a score of less than 1%, a  population for which single-agent PD-1 and PD-L1  inhibition have a small chance of benef it.12,14-19 The  greatest relative benef it was observed in the sub- group with a PD-L1 tumor proport ion score of  50% or greater, a f inding that was consistent with  the results of previous studies of PD-1 pathway  inhibit ion in advanced NSCLC.14,15,20,21 An impor- tant quest ion for further study is whether the  addit ion of pembrolizumab to pemetrexed and a  plat inum-based drug has greater ef f icacy than  pembrolizumab monotherapy in these pat ients.  Without direct comparisons, physicians and pa- t ients will need to have an individualized discus- sion of benef it.22 Although the outcomes in the placebo-combi- nation group appeared to be poorer than those in  patients who had received pemetrexed and a plati- num-based drug in some historical studies,23-25 the  rates of disease control and progression-free sur- vival were consistent with those in many landmark  studies.12,26-29 The median overall sur vival in our  trial may change with longer follow-up because  there was substant ial censoring of the Kaplan– Meier cur ves around the t ime that the medians  were reached in this analysis. As expected in the  era of immunotherapy, the survival cur ves in the

The as-treated population included all the patients who had undergone randomization and  received at least one dose of the assigned combination therapy. †  This category includes patients who discontinued pemetrexed, a platinum-based drug, and pembrolizumab or placebo because of an ad- verse event at any time and patients who discontinued pemetrexed and pembrolizumab or placebo for an adverse event after completing  four cycles of a platinum-based drug. ‡  Patients could have discontinued one, two, or all agents for a given adverse event. §  The adverse events leading to death in the pembrolizumab-combination group were pneumonitis in 3 patients; intestinal ischemia in 2 pa- tients; and acute kidney injury, acute kidney injury plus neutropenic sepsis, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrest plus respiratory failure, cardiac fail- ure, cardiopulmonary failure, cerebral infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, encephalopathy, hemoptysis, ischemic stroke, lung  infection, mesenteric-artery embolism, myocardial infarction, neutropenic sepsis, peritonitis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, pneumonia,  and septic shock in 1 patient each; 3 of the deaths in this group had an unspecified cause. The adverse events leading to death in the place- bo-combination group were cerebral hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemoptysis, intracranial hemorrhage, hypokale- mia plus supraventricular tachycardia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonia plus respiratory failure, renal failure,  respiratory failure, and septic shock in 1 patient each; 1 of the deaths in this group had an unspecified cause. ¶  The events are listed in descending order of frequency in the pembrolizumab-combination group.

*  The events of interest are those with an immune-related cause and are considered regardless of attribution to a trial  drug by the investigator. The events are listed in descending order of frequency in the pembrolizumab-combination  group. In addition to the specific preferred terms that are listed, related terms were also included. The as-treated popu- lation included all the patients who had undergone randomization and received at least one dose of the assigned com- bination therapy.
two groups seemed to be reaching a plateau at  the t ime of this analysis. The addit ion of pembrolizumab did not ap- pear to increase the frequency of adverse events  that are commonly associated with chemotherapy  regimens involving pemetrexed and a plat inum- based drug. Similarly, the incidence of most im- mune-mediated adverse events was not higher  with pembrolizumab-combinat ion therapy than  that previously obser ved with pembrolizumab  monotherapy.12,14,20 The exception may be nephritis  and acute kidney injur y, both of which are also  associated with pemetrexed30 and platinum-based  drugs31 and occurred with a greater frequency in  this trial than in earlier trials of pembrolizumab  monotherapy.12,14,20 The frequency of deaths attrib- uted to pneumonit is in this trial was consistent  with the frequency previously observed with pem- brolizumab monotherapy in advanced NSCLC.12,14,20 In conclusion, in patients with metastatic non- squamous NSCLC without sensit izing EGFR or  ALK mutat ions, the addit ion of pembrolizumab 
to induct ion therapy with pemetrexed and a  plat inum-based drug and to pemetrexed mainte- nance therapy resulted in signif icant ly longer  overall survival and progression-free survival and  a higher response rate than the addit ion of pla- cebo at a cost of a low incidence of renal dysfunc- tion at the f irst interim analysis. The sur vival  benef it for pembrolizumab-combinat ion therapy  was obser ved across all categories of PD-L1 ex- pression.
