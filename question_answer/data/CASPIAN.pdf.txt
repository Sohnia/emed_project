Summary
Background Most patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) have extensive-stage disease at presentation, and  prognosis remains poor. Recently, immunotherapy has demonstrated clinical activity in extensive-stage SCLC  (ES-SCLC). The CASPIAN trial assessed durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, in combination with etoposide  plus either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum–etoposide) in treatment-naive patients with ES-SCLC.
Methods This randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial was done at 209 sites across 23 countries. Eligible patients were  adults with untreated ES-SCLC, with WHO performance status 0 or 1 and measurable disease as per Response  Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to durvalumab plus  platinum–etoposide; durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide; or platinum–etoposide alone. All  drugs were administered intravenously. Platinum–etoposide consisted of etoposide 80–100 mg/m² on days 1–3 of  each cycle with investigator’s choice of either carboplatin area under the curve 5–6 mg/mL per min or cisplatin  75–80 mg/m² (administered on day 1 of each cycle). Patients received up to four cycles of platinum–etoposide plus  durvalumab 1500 mg with or without tremelimumab 75 mg every 3 weeks followed by maintenance durvalumab  1500 mg every 4 weeks in the immunotherapy groups and up to six cycles of platinum–etoposide every 3 weeks plus  prophylactic cranial irradiation (investigator’s discretion) in the platinum–etoposide group. The primary endpoint  was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. We report results for the durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide group versus the platinum–etoposide group from a planned interim analysis. Safety was assessed in all  patients who received at least one dose of their assigned study treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,  NCT03043872, and is ongoing.
Findings Patients were enrolled between March 27, 2017, and May 29, 2018. 268 patients were allocated to the  durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group and 269 to the platinum–etoposide group. Durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 0·73 (95% CI  0·59–0·91; p=0·0047]); median overall survival was 13·0 months (95% CI 11·5–14·8) in the durvalumab plus  platinum–etoposide group versus 10·3 months (9·3–11·2) in the platinum–etoposide group, with 34% (26·9–41·0)  versus 25% (18·4–31·6) of patients alive at 18 months. Any-cause adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 163 (62%)  of 265 treated patients in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group and 166 (62%) of 266 in the platinum– etoposide group; adverse events leading to death occurred in 13 (5%) and 15 (6%) patients.
Interpretation First-line durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide significantly improved overall survival in patients with  ES-SCLC versus a clinically relevant control group. Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profiles of  all drugs received.

Introduction
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 13–17% of all  diagnosed cases of lung cancer and is characterised by  rapid proliferation, high growth fraction, and early  development of widespread metastases.1,2 Less than  7% of patients with SCLC remain alive at 5 years after 
diagnosis.2,3 Extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) accounts  for about two-thirds of all cases of SCLC.1 For more than  three decades, the standard first-line treatment has  consisted of etoposide plus either cisplatin or carboplatin  (platinum–etoposide), with few alternatives.4–7 Despite  initial response rates of up to 78% for patients treated

Research in context
Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on July 8, 2019, for clinical trials  published in English with the terms “PD-1” OR “PD-L1”  OR “pembrolizumab” OR “nivolumab” OR “atezolizumab”  OR “durvalumab” OR “avelumab” AND “extensive-disease”  OR “extensive-stage” AND “first-line” OR “previously  untreated” OR “treatment-naive” AND “small-cell lung cancer”  OR “SCLC”, selecting relevant publications published within the  past 5 years ( Jan 1, 2014, to July 8, 2019). We also searched the  abstracts from the 2018 and 2019 American Society of Clinical  Oncology Annual Meetings, the 2018 European Society for  Medical Oncology Congress, and the 2018 World Conference  on Lung Cancer using the same search terms. We identified  one study of atezolizumab plus carboplatin–etoposide  (IMpower133), which indicated the therapeutic value of  immunotherapy targeting the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)  and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway to treat  patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC)  in the first-line setting.
Added value of this study The phase 3, randomised, open-label CASPIAN study showed a  statistically significant improvement in overall survival (primary  study endpoint) with first-line durvalumab and etoposide plus 
either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum–etoposide) versus  platinum–etoposide alone in patients with ES-SCLC at a  planned interim analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first  phase 3 study of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 in patients with  ES-SCLC that permitted the use of investigator’s choice of either  cisplatin or carboplatin as the platinum component in  platinum–etoposide and that allowed up to six cycles of  platinum–etoposide (consistent with routine clinical practice)  in the control group, compared with four cycles in the  durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group.
Implications of all the available evidence In CASPIAN, the addition of durvalumab to platinum–etoposide  as first-line treatment for patients with ES-SCLC resulted in  consistent and durable clinical benefit across overall survival,  progression-free survival, and objective response, compared  with a clinically relevant control group that is reflective of  current global clinical practice for this challenging-to-treat  disease. Our results align with those from the IMpower133 trial  of atezolizumab plus carboplatin–etoposide, while providing  significant progress in offering the flexibility of platinum choice  in combination with immunotherapy, expanding treatment  options for patients and physicians.
with platinum–etoposide,8,9 most patients relapse within  6 months of completing initial treatment and median  overall survival is about 10 months.4,8,10 Outside of  Japan, the current standard-of-care treatment in the  second-line setting is topotecan,5,6 which is associated  with poor outcomes (response rates of 5% and a 1-year  survival rate of 9% in patients with platinum-refractory  disease),11 emphasising the significant unmet need for  improved first-line therapies. Immunotherapy  targeting  the programmed cell  death 1 (PD-1, also known as PDCD1) and programmed  cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1, also known as CD274) pathway  has demonstrated clinical activity for patients with  ES-SCLC, including as first-line treatment.12 Durvalumab,  a selective, high-affinity human IgG1 monoclonal anti- body that blocks PD-L1 binding to PD-1 and CD80,13 is  indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable,  stage 3 non-small-cell lung cancer following platinum- based chemoradiotherapy.14–17 In early-phase clinical trials,  durvalumab, both as monotherapy and in combination  with the anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4  antibody, tremelimumab, showed durable clinical activity  and a manageable safety profile in patients with pretreated  ES-SCLC, including those with relapsed or refractory  disease.18–20 In CASPIAN, we assessed the efficacy and safety of  durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, in com- bination with platinum–etoposide for the first-line  treatment of patients with ES-SCLC. We report results  from a planned interim analysis of overall survival for 
durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide versus platinum– etoposide alone; the durvalumab plus tremelimumab  plus platinum–etoposide versus platinum–etoposide  alone comparison is proceeding to final analysis.
Methods
Study design
This randomised, open-label, sponsor-blind, phase 3 trial  was performed at 209 sites in 23 countries across Europe,  Asia, North America, and South America. The study was  done in accordance with the International Conference  on Harmonisation good clinical practice guidelines, the  Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable local regulations  with approval from an independent ethics committee or  institutional review boards. The protocol and all modifi- cations were approved by relevant ethics committees and  regulatory authorities.
Patients
Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years (20 years in  Japan) with treatment-naive histologically or cytologically  documented ES-SCLC (American Joint Committee on  Cancer, 7th edition, stage IV [T any, N any, M1a or M1b],  or T3–4 due to multiple lung nodules that are too  extensive or tumour or nodal volume that is too large  to be encompassed in a tolerable radiation plan).  Other eligibility criteria were a WHO performance  status score of 0 or 1; measurable disease according to  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  version 1.1; life expectancy of at least 12 weeks from the

Articlesstudy start; bodyweight of at least 30 kg; suitability for  first-line platinum-based chemotherapy; adequate organ  and marrow function; and negative pregnancy test for  pre-menopausal women. Patients with brain metas ta ses  were eligible provided they were asymptomatic or treated  and stable off steroids and anticonvulsants for at least  1 month before study entry. Key exclusion criteria were history of radiotherapy to the  chest or planned consolidation chest radiotherapy; active  or previous autoimmune or inflammatory disorders;  paraneoplastic syndrome of autoimmune nature requiring  systemic  treatment; history of active primary  im- munodeficiency; and uncontrolled, concurrent illness or  active infections. Complete eligibility criteria are in the  appendix (pp 6–10). All patients provided written informed  consent for participation.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned using an interactive  voice-response or web-response system in a 1:1:1 ratio to  receive durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide, durvalumab  plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide, or plati- num–etoposide alone (appendix p 4). Randomisation was  stratified according to planned platinum (carboplatin or  cisplatin). Treatment was allocated in blocks of six in each  stratum via a schedule generated by Parexel (Waltham, MA,  USA) who used a computerised randomised list generator.  The study was open-label and allocation was unmasked  to investigators and patients. However, the sponsor was  masked to all aggregated efficacy and safety data.
Procedures
All drugs were administered intravenously. Across all  three study groups, chemotherapy consisted of etoposide  80–100 mg/m² (administered on days 1–3 of each 21-day  cycle), with investigator’s choice of either carboplatin  area under the curve 5–6 mg/mL per min or cisplatin  75–80 mg/m² (administered on day 1 of each cycle).  Patients in the immunotherapy groups received up to  four cycles of platinum–etoposide plus durvalumab  1500 mg with or without tremelimumab 75 mg every  3 weeks followed by mainte nance durvalumab 1500 mg  every 4 weeks. Patients in the platinum–etoposide group  could receive an addi tional two cycles of platinum– etoposide (up to six cycles total) and prophylactic  cranial irradiation (PCI) after chemotherapy at the  investigator’s discretion. Patients continued treatment  until disease progression per investigator assessment,  unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria  were met. Continuation of study treatment after disease  progression was permitted if there was evidence of  clinical benefit (appendix p 4). In-study crossover from  the platinum–etoposide to the immunotherapy plus  platinum–etoposide groups was not allowed. Tumour imaging was performed every 6 weeks for  the first 12 weeks, and every 8 weeks thereafter, until  confirmed objective disease progression. Survival was 
assessed every 2 months after treatment discontinuation.  Adverse events were graded according to National Cancer  Institute common terminology criteria for adverse  events, version 4.03.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was overall survival (time from  randomisation to death from any cause). Secondary  endpoints were progression-free survival (time from  randomisation to the date of objective disease progression  or death from any cause in the absence of progression);  objective response (unconfirmed; proportion of patients  with a complete response or partial response on at least  one visit); overall survival at 18 months, progression-free  survival at 6 and 12 months, and safety. Progression-free  survival and objective response were investigator-assessed  according to RECIST, version 1.1. Other prespecified  secondary endpoints were pharmacokinetics, immuno- genicity, and symptoms and health-related quality of  life assessments; these will be reported elsewhere.  Although confir mation of objective response was not  protocol defined, post-hoc analysis of confirmed objective  response is also reported here in the interest of scientific  rigor and to mitigate against the potential for bias. For  confirmed responses, a confirmatory scan was required  no sooner than 4 weeks after the initial complete or partial  response. Duration of (confirmed) response and overall  survival at 12 months were also analysed post hoc.
Statistical analysis
About 795 patients were needed for 1:1:1 randomisation  to obtain 425 events in the durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide and platinum–etoposide groups combined  and 425 events in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab  plus platinum–etoposide and platinum–etoposide  groups combined (80% maturity) for the final analysis  of overall survival. Sample size assumptions are detailed  in the appendix (p 11). The interim analysis of overall  survival was planned when approximately 318 events  had occurred both in the durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide and platinum–etoposide groups combined  and in the durva lumab plus tremelimumab plus  platinum–etoposide and platinum–etoposide groups  combined (60% maturity). Based on an assumed overall  survival hazard ratio (HR) of 0·71, we estimated that the  trial would have 71% power to demonstrate statistical  significance at the interim analysis with a two-sided  significance level of 1·43% (for overall α of 4%) for the  comparison of durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide  versus platinum–etoposide, although the actual α spend  was to be based on the observed number of events at  data cutoff. The study was considered to be positive if overall  survival was significantly longer with either durvalumab  plus platinum–etoposide versus platinum–etoposide or  durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum–etoposide  versus platinum–etoposide.

Progression-free survival was only to be formally tested  within the multiple testing procedure if both overall  survival primary analyses were significant. Overall survival and progression-free survival were  analysed using a stratified log-rank test adjusting for  planned platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin), with HRs and  95% CIs estimated using a Cox proportional hazards  model. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate  overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of 
response. A prespecified subgroup analysis of overall  survival was done to establish the consistency of  the treatment effect according to predefined baseline  characteristics of planned platinum (carboplatin vs  cisplatin), age (<65 years vs ≥65 years), sex (women vs  men), WHO performance status (0 vs 1), smoking status  (smoker vs non-smoker), brain or CNS metastases (yes vs  no), disease stage at diagnosis (stage III vs stage IV),  race (Asian vs non-Asian), and region (Asia vs Europe vs  North and South America). HRs and 95% CIs for patient  subgroups were calculated using an unstratified Cox pro- portional hazards model with treatment as the only  covariate. Sensitivity analyses for overall survival in cluded  assessment of the effect of additional predefined covariates  (the same as those included in the subgroup analysis) on  the HR estimate. A further sensitivity analysis of overall  survival was done to examine the censoring patterns to

Results
Between March 27, 2017, and May 29, 2018, 972 patients  were screened, of whom 167 were excluded and 805 were  randomly assigned to durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide (n=268), durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus  platinum–etoposide (n=268), and platinum–etoposide  alone (n=269; figure 1). At the time of the planned  interim overall survival analysis,  the  independent  data monitoring committee recom mended that the  durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide and platinum– etoposide groups be unmasked to the sponsor because  this comparison met the predefined threshold for  statistical significance. The durvalumab plus  tre- melimumab plus platinum–etoposide group had not met  the predefined statistical significance threshold at the  time of the interim analysis and therefore the sponsor  remains masked to this group, which is continuing to the  planned final overall survival analysis. Thus, here we  report the results of the durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide group and platinum–etoposide group.  Important protocol deviations, defined as those that  could substantially affect the completeness, accu racy, or  reliability of the study data, or a patient’s rights, safety, or  wellbeing, were reported in 19 (4%) of 537 ran- domised patients: 11 in the durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide group and eight in the platinum–etoposide  group (appendix p 12).

disease characteristics were well balanced between the  durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide and platinum– etoposide groups (table 1). The median age was 63 years  (IQR 57–68) and most patients were men (374 [70%] of 
537), current or former smokers (500 [93%]), and had  stage IV disease at diagnosis (485 [90%]); at baseline,  55 (10%) patients had brain or CNS metastases and  212 (39%) patients had liver metastases.

Of the 531 patients who  did receive treatment, 416 (78%) received carboplatin  and 132 (25%) received cisplatin. In the durvalumab  plus platinum–etoposide group, the median number of  durvalumab doses received was 7 (IQR 6–11); 64 (24%)  of 265 treated patients received 12 or more doses  (table 2). In the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide  group, 230 patients (87%) received the planned maxi- mum of four cycles of platinum–etoposide. In the  platinum–etoposide group, 225 (85%) of 266 treated  patients received at least four cycles of platinum– etoposide, and 151 patients (57%) received the maximum  six cycles (table 2). As of March 11, 2019 (data cutoff),  43 patients in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide  group and none in the platinum–etoposide group  remained on study treatment. 113 (42%) of 268 patients  in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group  and 119 (44%) of 269 in the platinum–etoposide  group received at least one subsequent systemic anti- cancer therapy, with nearly all receiving chemotherapy;  a small proportion of patients received subsequent  immuno therapy (five [2%] in the durvalumab plus  platinum–etoposide group and 14 [5%] in the platinum– etoposide group; appendix p 13). 21 (8%) of 269 patients  in the platinum–etoposide group received PCI after  chemotherapy. At data cutoff, the median duration of follow-up for  overall survival in censored patients was 14·2 months  (IQR 11·7–17·0). There were 336 deaths across the  durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide and platinum– etoposide groups (62·6% maturity); 155 (58%) patients  had died in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide  group and 181 (67%) had died in the platinum–etoposide  group. The multiplicity-adjusted, two-sided α spent at this  interim analysis was 1·78% (ie, a p value less than  0·0178 was considered statistically significant). Overall  survival was significantly longer in the durvalumab plus  platinum–etoposide group than the platinum–etoposide  group, with an HR of 0·73 (95% CI 0·59–0·91; p=0·0047;  figure 2A). Median overall survival was 13·0 months  (95% CI 11·5–14·8) with durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide versus 10·3 months (9·3–11·2) with platinum– etoposide; the post-hoc 12-month overall survival rates  were 54% (47·4–59·5) versus 40% (33·7–45·8); and  the prespecified 18-month overall survival rates were  34% (26·9–41·0) versus 25% (18·4–31·6). The overall survival benefit with durvalumab plus  platinum–etoposide was consistently observed across  prespecified patient subgroups defined by baseline clinical  and demographic characteristics (figure 2B) and across  the prespecified sensitivity analysis of the effect of  additional covariates on the HR estimate (data not shown).  The sensitivity analysis examining censoring patterns to  identify potential attrition bias indicated that there was  more early censoring in the platinum–etoposide group  than in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group.

Table 3: Summary of tumour response
Early censoring (>10 weeks before data cutoff) occurred in  two (1%) of 268 patients for durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide compared with eight (3%) of 269 patients for  platinum–etoposide. Most of these cases (nine of ten)  were because of withdrawal of consent. At the time of data cutoff, 226 (84%) of 268 patients in  the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group and  233 (87%) of 269 patients in the platinum–etoposide  group had disease progression or died. Although  progression-free survival could not be tested for sig- nificance within the multiple-testing procedure at the  time of the interim analysis because of the design of  the study, an HR of 0·78 (95% CI 0·65–0·94) for the  comparison was recorded (figure 2C). Median progres- sion-free survival was 5·1 months (95% CI 4·7–6·2) with  durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide versus 5·4 months  (4·8–6·2) with platinum–etoposide; the 6-month pro gres- sion-free survival rates were 45% (39·3–51·3) versus  46% (39·3–51·7); and the 12-month progression-free  survival rates were 18% (13·1–22·5) versus 5% (2·4–8·0). The proportion of patients with an investigator-asses- sed unconfirmed objective response was higher with  durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide than with platinum– etoposide; 213 (79%) of 268 patients had an objective  response in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide

group compared with 189 (70%) of 269 patients in the  platinum–etoposide group (odds ratio [OR] 1·64 [95% CI  1·11–2·44]). Confirmed responses were analysed post hoc;  182 (68%) of 268 patients had a confirmed objective  response in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide  group compared with 155 (58%) of 269 patients in the  platinum–etoposide group (OR 1·56 [1·10–2·22; table 3).  Six (2%) patients in the durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide group and two (1%) patients in the platinum– etoposide group achieved a confirmed complete response.  The median duration of (confirmed) response was the  same for both groups. Of the patients with a confirmed 
response, the estimated percentage remaining in response  at 12 months was higher with durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide than with platinum–etoposide. Adverse events of any cause and grade occurred in  260 (98%) of 265 patients treated with durvalumab plus  platinum–etoposide and 258 (97%) of 266 patients  treated with platinum–etoposide (table 4). Grade 3 or  4 adverse events occurred in 163 (62%) patients in the  durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group and  166 (62%) patients in the platinum–etoposide group and  adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in  25 (9%) patients in each group. The most common  grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia and  anaemia. Deaths due to adverse events of any cause  occurred in 13 (5%) patients in the durvalumab plus  platinum–etoposide group and 15 (6%) patients in the  platinum–etoposide group (table 4). Treatment-related  adverse events, serious ad verse events, and adverse  events leading to discontin uation are described in the  appendix (pp 14–19). Immune-mediated adverse events  (imAEs) were  reported in 52 (20%) of 265 patients treated with  durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide and seven (3%) of  266 patients treated with platinum–etoposide (appendix  pp 20–21). Most of these events were grade 1 or 2; grade 3 or  4 imAEs occurred in 12 patients (5%) in the durvalumab  plus platinum–etoposide group and one patient (<1%) in  the platinum–etoposide group. Deaths due to imAEs  occurred in one (<1%) patient in each group; causes  of death were hepatotoxicity in the durvalumab plus  platinum–etoposide group and pneumonitis  in the  platinum–etoposide group. The most common imAEs  were hypothyroid events (occurring in 24 [9%] patients  in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group and  two [1%] patients in the platinum–etoposide group) and  hyperthyroid events (occurring in 14 [5%] and none), which  were all grade 1 or 2 in severity.
Discussion
The CASPIAN trial met its primary endpoint of overall  survival for durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide versus  platinum–etoposide at the planned interim analysis.  Durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide demonstrated  a statistically significant and clinically meaningful im- provement in overall survival versus platinum–etoposide  alone, with an HR of 0·73 (95% CI 0·59–0·91; p=0·0047).  Overall survival benefit was observed across all clinically  rele vant patient subgroups. Consistent with the results  for overall survival, progression-free survival (assessed  without formal statistical significance testing) was also in  favour of durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide, as were  both unconfirmed and confirmed objective response.  Overall survival benefit was durable for durvalumab  plus platinum–etoposide, as evidenced by the tail of the  Kaplan-Meier curve; in the durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide group, more patients were alive at 12 months  and 18 months (prespecified endpoint) than in the

Articlesplatinum–etoposide group. Sustained clinical benefit  was also observed across progression-free survival and  tumour response with durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide, with a higher 12-month progres sion-free  survival rate and more patients remaining in response at  12 months in the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide  group than in the platinum–etoposide group. These  clinical benefits were observed in the context of  a clinically relevant control group that permitted up  to six cycles of platinum–etoposide (compared with  four cycles in the immunotherapy group) and PCI at  the investigator’s discretion. Furthermore, in both  groups, the platinum component of platinum–etoposide  included either carboplatin or cisplatin, as chosen by the  investigator. Our results, which align with those from the recent  IMpower133 trial12 of atezolizumab plus carboplatin– etoposide, represent progress in clinical outcomes for  patients with ES-SCLC treated in the first-line setting.  However, some notable study design differences between  CASPIAN and IMpower133 exist, including the use of up  to six cycles of platinum–etoposide in the control group of  CASPIAN (up to four cycles were permitted in the control  group of IMpower133), as well as the use of investigator’s  choice of platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) across both  groups. For the platinum–etoposide group of CASPIAN,  median overall survival was con sistent with previous  reports,8,10,12 whereas the median progression-free survival  was longer than that observed in the control group in  IMpower133.12 Although the scan schedule in CASPIAN  was the same for both treatment groups, it differed  slightly from that in IMpower133. The better early  performance in the control group of CASPIAN might be  driven by the fact that more than half of the patients  in the platinum–etoposide group of CASPIAN received  six cycles of platinum–etoposide, compared with the  maximum of four cycles in the control group of  IMpower133.12 Notably, the addition of durvalumab to  platinum–etoposide in CASPIAN did not compromise  the number of cycles of platinum–etoposide received,  because a similar majority of patients received at least  four cycles in each group (87% in the durvalumab plus  platinum–etoposide group and 85% in the platinum– etoposide group). At the time of designing the CASPIAN  study, the guidelines recommended between four and  six cycles of platinum–etoposide, because no evidence  supported that six cycles of platinum–etoposide would  result in a better outcome than four cycles. Additionally,  safety data were scarce for the combi nation of chemo- therapy and  immunotherapy  in SCLC. Therefore,  platinum–etoposide was limited to the minimum recom- mended number of cycles (ie, four) in the immu notherapy  groups, whereas up to six cycles of platinum–etoposide  were allowed in the control group to reflect current clinical  practice. Although the treatment effect with durvalumab plus  platinum–etoposide versus platinum–etoposide was well 
sustained over the study period, longer follow-up is  required to ascertain the long-term survival benefit in  patients who responded to durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide. Use of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors has resulted in  a significant proportion of long-term survivors among  patients with different stages of non-small-cell lung  cancer;21–23 however, the extent of long-term survival  benefit with immunotherapy remains to be demonstrated  in SCLC. Further study to identify patients with SCLC  who might derive long-term survival benefit is warranted,  including analyses of biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression  and tumour mutation burden. A better understanding of  the underlying biology is important to discover which  patients with this heterogeneous disease might derive  greater treatment benefit, so that therapy may be tailored  to the individual. In patients with ES-SCLC, brain metastases are  common and associated with poor clinical outcomes.  The role of PCI in patients with ES-SCLC after treatment  with platinum–etoposide remains controversial, with  conflicting evidence regarding its potential survival  benefit.24–26 In CASPIAN, because no safety data were  available regarding the use of PCI concurrently with  immune checkpoint blockade targeting the PD-1 and  PD-L1 pathway at the time of study start, PCI was only  permitted in the platinum–etoposide group at the  investigator’s discretion; 21 (8%) patients in the control  group received PCI. Further investigation is required  to define the role of PCI in ES-SCLC, particularly with  the use of immune checkpoint blockade targeting  the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathway in combination with  chemotherapy. The overall safety profile in CASPIAN was similar  between the two groups, with similar frequencies of  grade 3 or 4 adverse events, adverse events leading to  discontinuation, and adverse events leading to death.  The most common adverse events were haematological  toxicities, some of which were numerically higher in the  platinum–etoposide group, potentially because of the  greater number of platinum–etoposide cycles received in  the control group than in the durvalumab plus platinum– etoposide group. Immune-mediated adverse events  were mostly low grade and manageable with standard  treatment guidelines and were numerically higher in  the durvalumab plus platinum–etoposide group than  the platinum–etoposide group, driven by thyroid endo- crinopathies, and consistent with the known safety  profile of durvalumab.27 A limitation of the study is its open-label design, which  could potentially affect study conduct and secondary  endpoints such as investigator assessment of response  and progression, attribution of adverse events, and  patient withdrawals. However, the primary study end- point was overall survival, which is not subject to open- label bias. Furthermore, progression-free survival in the  control group was in line with historical data, and safety  regardless of cause was similar between the two groups,

Finally,  although there was more early censoring  in the  platinum–etoposide group than in the durvalumab plus  platinum–etoposide group, the patient numbers were  small and are not considered to have affected the overall  conclusions. In conclusion, this randomised, open-label, phase 3  trial demonstrated that the addition of durvalumab to  platinum–etoposide as first-line treatment for ES-SCLC  resulted in significantly longer overall survival than with  a control group reflective of current clinical practice  worldwide.5–7 The safety profile was consistent with  previous reports of both durvalumab and platinum– etoposide. These results represent an important step  forward in providing the flexibility of combining immu- notherapy with different platinum-based regimens in  ES-SCLC, expanding treatment options for both patients  and physicians.
