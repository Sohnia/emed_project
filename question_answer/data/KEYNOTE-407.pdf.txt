BACKGROUND
Standard f irst-line therapy for metastat ic, squamous non–small-cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) is platinum-based chemotherapy or pembrolizumab (for patients with pro- grammed death ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression on ≥50% of tumor cells). More recently,  pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was shown to signif icantly prolong overall sur- vival among pat ients with nonsquamous NSCLC.
METHODS
In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 559 patients  with untreated metastat ic, squamous NSCLC to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab  or saline placebo for up to 35 cycles; all the pat ients also received carboplat in and  either paclitaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound [nab]–paclitaxel for the f irst 4 cy- cles. Primar y end points were overall survival and progression-free survival.
RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 7.8 months, the median overall survival was 15.9 months  (95% conf idence inter val [CI], 13.2 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab-combi- nat ion group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 14.8) in the placebo-combinat ion  group (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; P<0.001). The overall sur- vival benef it was consistent regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression. The median  progression-free survival was 6.4 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 8.3) in the pembrolizumab- combination group and 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7) in the placebo-combinat ion  group (hazard rat io for disease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70;  P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 69.8% of the pat ients in  the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 68.2% of the patients in the placebo- combination group. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events was more  frequent in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebo-combination  group (13.3% vs. 6.4%).
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with previously untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC, the addition of  pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel  resulted in signif icantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than che- motherapy alone.

Squamous non–small-cell lung can- cer (NSCLC) accounts for approx imately  20 to 30% of all lung cancers and is associ- ated with shorter survival than is nonsquamous  NSCLC.1-4 Historically, the lack of targetable aber- rations meant that treatment for squamous NSCLC  was mostly limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy. The  combinat ion of the epidermal growth factor re- ceptor inhibitor necitumumab and chemotherapy  with gemcitabine and cisplat in in the f irst-line  treatment of squamous NSCLC signif icant ly pro- longed overall survival, as compared with chemo- therapy alone, but the magnitude of benef it was  sma ll.5 Inhibitors of programmed death recep- tor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 are ef fect ive in  the treatment of squamous and nonsquamous  NSCLC.6 -11 To determine whether the addit ion of  the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (Key t ruda,  Merck) to platinum-based chemotherapy improves  outcomes in pat ients with squamous NSCLC of  any level of PD-L1 expression, we conducted the  global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3  KEYNOTE-407 trial, which compared pembroli- zumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin and either  paclitaxel or nanopart icle albumin-bound [nab]– paclitaxel [Abraxane, Celgene]) with placebo plus  chemotherapy (carboplat in and either paclitaxel  or nab-paclitaxel).
M e t h od s
Patients
Pat ients were eligible for enrollment if they were  18 years of age or older, had pathologically con- f irmed stage IV squamous NSCLC (as classif ied  according to the seventh edition of the Cancer Stag- ing Manual of the American Joint Committee on  Cancer12), had received no previous systemic  therapy for metastatic disease, had an Eastern Co- operat ive Oncolog y Group (ECOG) performance- status score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with  higher scores indicat ing increasing disabilit y; a  score of 0 indicates no symptoms, and 1 mild  symptoms),13 had at least one measurable lesion  according to version 1.1 of the Response Evalua- t ion Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST),14 and  provided a tumor sample for the determinat ion  of PD-L1 status. Pat ients were excluded if they  had symptomat ic central ner vous system metas- tases, had a histor y of noninfect ious pneumoni-
t is that required the use of glucocort icoids, had  act ive autoimmune disease, or were receiving  systemic immunosuppressive treatment. Full eli- gibility criteria are listed in the trial protocol, avail- able with the full text of this art icle at NEJM.org.
Trial Design and Treatments
In this double-blind trial, randomizat ion was  performed with the use of an interact ive voice- response and integrated Web-response system.  Randomization was stratif ied according to PD-L1  tumor proportion score (≥1% vs. <1%; tumor pro- portion score is the percentage of tumor cells with  membranous PD-L1 staining, with <1% indicating  PD-L1–negat ive), choice of taxane (paclitaxel vs.  nab-paclitaxel), and geographic region of enroll- ment (East Asia vs. the rest of the world). Patients  were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 rat io, to receive  200 mg of pembrolizumab or saline placebo on  day 1 for up to 35 cycles. For the f irst 4 cycles,  all the patients also received carboplatin (at a dose  calculated to produce an area under the concen- tration–time curve of 6 mg per milliliter per min- ute) on day 1 and either paclitaxel (200 mg per  square meter of body-surface area) on day 1 or  nab-paclitaxel (100 mg per square meter) on days  1, 8, and 15. All treatments were administered  intravenously in 3-week cycles. The pat ients who  received paclitaxel also received premedicat ion  with a glucocorticoid, a type 1 antihistamine, and  a t ype 2 ant ihistamine according to local guide- lines; premedicat ion with a glucocort icoid and  antihistamines was not required for patients who  received nab-paclitaxel. The assigned treatment was cont inued unt il  radiographic disease progression, the occurrence  of unacceptable toxic effects, an investigator’s deci- sion to discont inue the treatment, or withdrawal  of patient consent. If toxic effects were clearly at- tributed to one component of the treatment, that  component alone could be discontinued. Patients  who had radiographic disease progression but  were clinically stable could cont inue to receive  treatment at the discretion of an investigator until  disease progression was conf irmed by imaging  performed at least 28 days after the imaging as- sessment that f irst showed disease progression.  The trial-group assignment could be unblinded for  a patient who had disease progression conf irmed  by blinded, independent review of radiologic im-

ages at a central laborator y; such pat ients in the  placebo-combination group were eligible to cross  over to receive pembrolizumab monotherapy if all  protocol-specif ied criteria were met. Pat ients in  the pembrolizumab-combination group who were  deemed to have clinical benef it from treatment  despite radiographically conf irmed disease pro- gression were permitted to cont inue open-label  pembrolizumab monotherapy. Addit ional details  regarding treatment decisions, management of  adverse events, and eligibilit y criteria for cross- over are available in the protocol.
Assessments
The PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay (Agilent  Technologies) was used to assess PD-L1 expression  in formalin-f ixed tumor samples obtained at the  time metastatic disease was diagnosed. PD-L1 ex- pression was assessed during screening at a central  laboratory and was characterized according to the  tumor proport ion score.15 Invest igators and pa- tients were unaware of the tumor proportion score.  Adverse events and abnormal laboratory f indings  were graded according to the National Cancer In- stitute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse  Events, version 4.03. Tumor imaging was sched- uled for weeks 6, 12, and 18 and then ever y  9 weeks through week 45 and every 12 weeks  thereafter. Response was assessed according to  RECIST, version 1.1.14 Pat ients were contacted  to assess survival every 12 weeks during follow-up.
Trial Oversight
The trial was designed by a panel of academic advi- sors and employees of Merck Sharp & Dohme, the  sponsor of the trial. An external, independent  monitoring committee oversaw the trial and as- sessed ef f icacy and safet y at prespecif ied interim  analyses. The trial protocol and all amendments  were approved by the appropriate ethics committee  at each participating center. All patients provided  written informed consent before enrollment. The authors vouch for the accuracy and com- pleteness of the data and for the f idelit y of the  trial to the protocol. The trial was conducted in  accordance with the provisions of the International  Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Prac- tice guidelines. All the authors had access to the  data. Assistance in the preparat ion of the manu- script was provided by a medical writer employed  by the sponsor, and all the authors participated in  writing or reviewing and editing the manuscript.
S tatis tic al Analysis
The trial had dual primar y end points of overall  survival and progression-free survival, which was  assessed by means of blinded, independent central  review of radiologic images. The secondar y end  points were response rate and durat ion of re- sponse, which were assessed by means of blinded,  independent central radiologic review, and safety.  The effects of PD-L1 expression on overall survival,  progression-free sur vival, and response rate were  prespecif ied exploratory end points. Eff icacy was  assessed in the intent ion-to-treat populat ion,  which included all pat ients who underwent ran- domizat ion. Safet y was assessed in the as-treat- ed populat ion, which included all pat ients who  underwent randomizat ion and received at least  one dose of the assigned combinat ion treatment. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to est i- mate overall sur vival, progression-free sur vival,  and durat ion of response. The strat if ied log-rank  test was used to assess between-group differences  in overall and progression-free sur vival. A strat i- f ied Cox proport ional-hazards model and Efron’s  method of t ie handling were used to assess the  magnitude of the dif ference between the trial  groups. There was no violation of the proportional- hazards model in the intention-to-treat population.  In some subgroups, there was a delayed separa- t ion of the sur vival curves, suggest ing a possible  deviation from the proportional-hazards assump- tion. The stratif ied method of Miettinen and Nur- minen was used to assess differences in response  rate. The randomization stratif ication factors were  applied to all strat if ied analyses. The full stat ist ical analysis plan is available  with the protocol. The graphical method of Mau- rer and Bretz was used to control the family-wise  t ype I error rate at a one-sided alpha level of  0.025 across all hypotheses and interim analyses  (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available  at NEJM.org). We determined that with a sample  of 560 pat ients, the trial would have 90% power  to show a hazard ratio for disease progression or  death of 0.70 at a one-sided alpha level of 0.01  (as calculated on the basis of 415 events of disease  progression or death) and 85% power to show a  hazard ratio for death of 0.70 at a one-sided alpha  level of 0.01 (as calculated on the basis of 361  deaths) for the comparison between the pembro- lizumab-combination group and the placebo-com- bination group.

of two interim analyses and a f inal analysis  (Table S1 in the Supplementar y Appendix). To  improve the abilit y of the trial to ident if y long- term treatment effects, the protocol was amended  to specify the performance of three interim analy- ses and a f inal analysis (Table S1 in the Supple- mentar y Appendix). The second interim analysis  was to be performed after enrollment was com- plete and approximately 332 events of disease  progression or death had been obser ved; it was  est imated that approximately 212 deaths would  be observed at this time. As of April 3, 2018, there  were 349 events of disease progression or death  and 205 deaths, and the mult iplicit y-adjusted,  one-sided a lpha spent at this interim ana lysis  (as determined on the basis of the Lan–DeMets  O’Brien–Fleming spending function) was 0.008 for  progression-free sur viva l and 0.0029 for overa ll  survival. The external monitoring committee re- viewed the results of the second interim analysis  on May 21, 2018. Because the committee reported  that the eff icacy boundaries for the primary hy- potheses of overall sur vival and progression-free  sur vival had been met, the decision was made to  report the results of the second interim analysis.  The trial is cont inuing in order to evaluate out- comes with addit ional follow-up.

Patients and Treatments
A total of 779 pat ients from 137 sites in 17 coun- tries were screened for randomizat ion (Fig. S2 in  the Supplementary Appendix). Of the 561 patients  who met all eligibilit y criteria, 2 were excluded  from randomization because of a physician’s deci- sion. Between August 19, 2016, and December 28,  2017, the remaining 559 pat ients from 125 sites  underwent randomizat ion; 278 pat ients were as- signed to the pembrolizumab-combination group  and 281 to the placebo-combinat ion group. With  respect to the stratif ication factors, a PD-L1 tumor  proport ion score of 1% or greater was obser ved  for 63.1% of patients, paclitaxel was the choice of  taxane for 60.1% of pat ients, and East Asia was  the region of enrollment for 19.0% of pat ients.  Baseline demographic and disease characteristics  were as expected for a trial involving patients with  metastat ic, squamous NSCLC and were well bal- anced between groups (Table 1). At least one dose of the assigned combinat ion  treatment was received by all 278 pat ients in the

pembrolizumab-combination group and by 280 of  281 pat ients in the placebo-combinat ion group.  The median duration of follow-up (def ined as the  t ime from randomizat ion to death or the date of  data cutof f for those who were alive) was 7.8  months (range, 0.1 to 19.1). The mean (±SD) dura- t ion of treatment was 6.3±4.1 months in the  pembrolizumab-combinat ion group and 4.7±3.5  months in the placebo-combinat ion group. Four  doses of carboplat in were received by 78.8% of  the pat ients in the pembrolizumab-combinat ion  group and by 73.2% of the patients in the placebo- combinat ion group (Table S2 in the Supplemen- tary Appendix). Among the patients who received  paclitaxel, 78.7% in the pembrolizumab-combi- nation group and 71.3% in the placebo-combina- t ion group received all 4 cycles; among the pa- tients who received nab-paclitaxel, 22.9% in the  pembrolizumab-combinat ion group and 21.2%  in the placebo-combinat ion group received all  12 doses (66.1% and 64.6%, respectively, received  5 to 11 doses) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Ap- pendix). As of April 3, 2018, a tota l of 121 pat ients  (43.5%) in the pembrolizumab-combination group  and 72 pat ients (25.7%) in the placebo-combina- t ion group were st ill receiving their assigned  treatment (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appen- dix). In the pembrolizumab-combinat ion group,  12 patients received pembrolizumab monotherapy  for a median of 3 cycles (range, 1 to 10) after dis- ease progression was conf irmed. In the placebo- combinat ion group, 75 pat ients crossed over to  receive pembrolizumab monotherapy in the trial  after the occurrence of disease progression, and  an addit ional 14 pat ients received a subsequent  PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor outside the trial; thus, the  effective crossover rates (i.e., the rates among the  pat ients who crossed over in the trial and those  who received the same treatment or class of treat- ment outside the in-trial crossover) were 31.7%  among the 281 pat ients in the intent ion-to-treat  populat ion and 42.8% among the 208 pat ients  who discontinued their assigned treatment for any  reason.
Effic acy
A total of 205 deaths occurred in the intent ion- to-treat populat ion; the median overall sur vival  was 15.9 months (95% conf idence inter val [CI],  13.2 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab-com- binat ion group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to

Kaplan–Meier est imates of the rate of  sur vival at 1 year were 65.2% in the pembroli- zumab-combinat ion group and 48.3% in the  placebo-combination group. The benef it of adding  pembrolizumab was observed in all prespecif ied  subgroups (Fig. 1B), including in the subgroups  def ined according to PD-L1 tumor proport ion  score (est imated 1-year sur vival rate among pa- t ients with a PD-L1 tumor proport ion score of  <1% in the pembrolizumab-combination group vs.  the placebo-combinat ion group, 64.2% vs. 43.3%  [hazard ratio for death, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.98];  among those with a score of 1 to 49%, 65.9% vs.  50.0% [hazard rat io, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.90];  and among those with a score of ≥50%, 63.4%  vs. 51.0% [hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.10])  (Fig. S3 in the Supplementar y Appendix). A total of 349 events of disease progression  or death occurred in the intent ion-to-treat popu- lation, as assessed by means of blinded, indepen- dent central radiologic review; the median pro- gression-free sur vival was 6.4 months (95% CI,  6.2 to 8.3) in the pembrolizumab-combinat ion  group and 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7) in the  placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for dis-

Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of progression-free sur vival in the two trial groups (Panel A) and an analysis of  progression-free sur vival in key prespecif ied subgroups (Panel B). Progression-free sur vival was assessed according  to version 1.1 of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors by means of blinded, independent central radio - logic review. Tick marks in Panel A indicate censoring of data at the last time the patient was known to be alive and  without disease progression (i.e., at the time of the last imaging assessment). In Panel B, progression-free sur vival  was analyzed in the overall population and in the subgroups def ined according to the PD -L1 tumor propor tion score  with the use of a Cox regression model that included trial group and the randomization stratif ication fac tors as co - variates; progression-free sur vival was analyzed in all the other subgroups with the use of an unstratif ied Cox regres- sion model that included trial group as a covariate.

The response rate, as assessed by means of  blinded, independent central radiologic review,  was 57.9% (95% CI, 51.9 to 63.8) in the pembro- lizumab-combinat ion group and 38.4% (95% CI,  32.7 to 44.4) in the placebo-combinat ion group.  The best overall response in each trial group is  summarized in Table S3 in the Supplementary  Appendix. The median t ime to response was 1.4  months in each group. The median durat ion of  response was 7.7 months (range, 1.1+ to 14.7+  [the plus sign indicates ongoing response at the  t ime of data cutof f ]) in the pembrolizumab- combinat ion group and 4.8 months (range, 1.3+  to 15.8+) in the placebo-combinat ion group (Fig.  S6 in the Supplementar y Appendix).

The most common adverse events in both trial  groups were anemia, alopecia, and neutropenia  (Table 2). Among the adverse events that were  reported in at least 10% of pat ients, alopecia and  pruritus occurred more frequently in the pembro- lizumab-combination group than in the placebo- combinat ion group, whereas back pain occurred  more frequently in the placebo-combination group;  after adjustment for exposure, rates of alopecia  and pruritus were similar in the groups (Fig. S7A  and Table S7 in the Supplementar y Appendix).  Adverse events of grade 3 or higher that occurred  in at least 10% of pat ients were anemia and neu- tropenia (Table 2). Adverse events of grade 3 or  higher that occurred more frequently in the pem- brolizumab-combinat ion group than in the pla- cebo-combinat ion group were pneumonit is and  autoimmune hepat it is (Fig. S7B in the Supple- mentary Appendix). Immune-mediated adverse  events and infusion react ions occurred in 28.8%  of pat ients in the pembrolizumab-combinat ion  group and in 8.6% of pat ients in the placebo- combinat ion group (Table 3); the events were of  grade 3 or higher in 10.8% and 3.2%, respec- t ively.

*  Listed are all adverse events that occurred during the trial period or within the 30 days thereafter (within 90 days for serious events), regard- less of attribution to any trial regimen by an investigator. Adverse events that occurred during crossover from the placebo-combination  group to pembrolizumab monotherapy are excluded. The as-treated population included all patients who underwent randomization and re- ceived at least one dose of the assigned combination treatment. †  This category includes patients who discontinued pembrolizumab or placebo, carboplatin, and paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel because of an ad- verse event at any time and patients who discontinued pembrolizumab or placebo for an adverse event after completing four cycles of car- boplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel. ‡  Patients could have discontinued one, two, or all agents for a given adverse event. §  The adverse events leading to death in the pembrolizumab-combination group were respiratory failure and sepsis in 3 patients each, cardiac  arrest and pulmonary hemorrhage in 2 patients each, and cardiac failure, circulatory collapse, hepatic failure, intestinal perforation, lung ab- scess, necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary sepsis in 1 patient each; 4 of the deaths in this group had an unspeci- fied cause. The adverse events leading to death in the placebo-combination group were septic shock in 3 patients, cardiorespiratory arrest in  2 patients, and acute kidney injury, cardiac arrest, hemothorax, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumonia, pneu- monitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary mycosis, and sepsis in 1 patient each; 3 of the deaths in this group had an unspecified cause. ¶  In the pembrolizumab-combination group, the adverse events leading to death that were attributed to one or more components of the trial  regimen by an investigator were sepsis in 3 patients and hepatic failure, necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and re- spiratory failure in 1 patient each; 2 of the deaths that were attributed to one or more components of the trial regimen in this group had an  unspecified cause. The adverse events leading to death that were attributed to a component of the trial regimen in the placebo-combination  group were septic shock in 2 patients and acute kidney injury, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia, and pulmonary hemor- rhage in 1 patient each. ‖  Events are listed in descending order of frequency in the pembrolizumab-combination group.

*  The adverse events of interest are infusion reactions and events with an immune-related cause; they are considered re- gardless of whether the investigator attributed the event to a trial regimen or considered the event to be immune-related.  The events are listed in descending order of frequency in the pembrolizumab-combination group. In addition to the  specific preferred terms that are listed, related terms were also included. The as-treated population included all patients  who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of the assigned combination treatment. †  Data include 1 patient (0.4%) in each trial group who had grade 5 pneumonitis.
PD-L1 tumor proport ion score (<1%, 1 to 49%,  and ≥50%), although the upper limit of the 95%  conf idence interval for the subgroup with a score  of 50% or greater exceeded 1. A higher response  rate and longer durat ion of response were also  obser ved. In the phase 3 SQUIRE (Squamous NSCLC  treatment with the Inhibitor of EGF Receptor)  trial involving patients with untreated metastatic,  squamous NSCLC, the median overall survival was  1.6 months longer (11.5 months vs. 9.9 months)  and the risk of death 16% lower among pat ients  who received necitumumab plus gemcitabine and  cisplat in than among those who received gem- citabine and cisplat in alone.5 The 11.3-month  median overall sur vival obser ved in the placebo- combinat ion group in the KEYNOTE-407 trial is  similar to the 11.5-month median overall sur- vival observed in the group that received necitum- umab plus gemcitabine and cisplat in in the  SQUIRE trial,5 a f inding that further validates  the benef it of adding pembrolizumab to chemo- therapy. The results of the current trial and of three  other phase 3 trials8,10,11 suggest that pembroli- zumab has a role in the f irst-line treatment of 
metastat ic NSCLC, regardless of histologic sub- type or PD-L1 tumor proportion score. In patients  with PD-L1–negative tumors, pembrolizumab plus  chemotherapy has shown a high level of activity as  compared with chemotherapy alone. In pat ients  with PD-L1–posit ive tumors, the current ly avail- able data do not permit the determinat ion of  whether pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy has  greater eff icacy than pembrolizumab alone. There- fore, the treatment decision should be made on  an individual basis after a discussion of the rela- t ive risks and benef its and considerat ion of pa- t ient-specif ic factors.16 The f indings with respect to other immune  checkpoint inhibitors in the f irst-line treatment  of metastat ic NSCLC have been mixed. In a re- view of the literature, we found that, to date,  pembrolizumab has been the only PD-1 or PD-L1  inhibitor to show a signif icant sur vival benef it  over chemotherapy when given as monotherapy  or as part of combinat ion therapy for metastat ic,  squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC.8,10,11,17-21 The  addit ion of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associ- ated protein 4 inhibitor ipilimumab to chemo- therapy with carboplat in and paclitaxel did not  prolong overall survival, as compared with che-

motherapy alone, among pat ients with advanced  squamous NSCLC.18 Recent ly reported data from  the phase 3 IMpower131 trial showed that the  risk of disease progression or death among pa- t ients with untreated metastat ic, squamous  NSCLC was 29% lower with the addit ion of the  PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab to carboplat in and  nab-paclitaxel than with carboplat in and nab- paclitaxel alone; no ef fect on overall sur vival was  obser ved in this interim analysis.19 The PD-L1 tumor proport ion score is an es- tablished biomarker for select ing pat ients with  metastat ic NSCLC for f irst-line pembrolizumab  monotherapy on the basis of the clear relat ion- ship between higher PD-L1 expression in tumors  and increasing benef it of pembrolizumab.8,10,22  Although there was a relationship between great- er PD-L1 expression and longer progression-free  survival in the KEYNOTE-407 trial and a relation- ship between greater PD-L1 expression and lon- ger overall and progression-free sur vival in a  phase 3 trial of pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed  and a plat inum-based drug for nonsquamous  NSCLC,11 the clinical usefulness of PD-L1 as a bio- marker in patients receiving combination therapy  may be less clear, given that the combination treat- ments improved outcomes over chemotherapy  across all categories of PD-L1 tumor proport ion  scores. Other potent ial biomarkers for immune  checkpoint inhibition have been evaluated, includ- ing tumor mutational burden, which appears to be  complementary to and nonoverlapping with PD-L1  expression.17,20,21 In the phase 3 CheckMate 227  trial, the risk of disease progression or death  among pat ients with previously untreated squa- mous or nonsquamous NSCLC with a high tumor  mutational burden was 42% lower with nivolumab  plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy.20 An  explorator y analysis of data from pat ients with  PD-L1–negative tumors suggested that high tumor  mutat ional burden may predict a progression- free sur vival benef it for nivolumab plus chemo- therapy over chemotherapy alone.21 Currently, the  abilit y of tumor mutat ional burden to predict an  overall sur vival benef it is uncertain.17,20,21 The adverse-event prof ile obser ved in the cur- rent trial was as expected on the basis of the  known events associated with pembrolizumab,  carboplat in, paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel, with  no new safet y signals ident if ied. Although the  rates of treatment discont inuat ion due to ad- verse events were generally low, more pat ients in  the pembrolizumab-combinat ion group than in 
the placebo-combinat ion group discont inued the  regimen because of adverse events, probably in  part because of the longer durat ion of treatment  in this group. A limitat ion of this trial is the short durat ion  of follow-up, which is a consequence of the sec- ond interim analysis being event-driven and not  time-driven. Given the stringency of the protocol- specif ied criteria for declaring statistical signif i- cance at the t ime of the second interim analysis,  the durabilit y of the benef it of pembrolizumab,  and results observed with long-term follow-up in  other studies of pembrolizumab-based therapy  in pat ients with metastat ic NSCLC,8,23-25 we ex- pect that the benef it obser ved in the pembroli- zumab-combination group will be maintained or  even increase with longer follow-up. The short  follow-up also precludes the identif ication of long- term toxic effects, although, on the basis of stud- ies of pembrolizumab monotherapy, long-term  toxic ef fects are not expected. This trial is being  continued to evaluate long-term eff icacy and safe- ty. Another limitat ion is the low percentage of  pat ients in the placebo-combinat ion group who  received a subsequent checkpoint inhibitor after  treatment components were discont inued. Spe- cif ic reasons for not receiving a subsequent check- point inhibitor were not collected and are not  clear. Possible reasons include death soon af ter  discontinuation or the decision to enter palliative  care. It is likely that the percentage of pat ients  who receive subsequent checkpoint inhibition will  increase with addit ional follow-up. In conclusion, the addition of pembrolizumab  to standard chemotherapy with carboplat in and  either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel in patients with  previously untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC  resulted in signif icantly longer overall survival and  progression-free sur vival, a higher response rate,  and a longer durat ion of response than chemo- therapy alone, regardless of the level of PD-L1 ex- pression.
