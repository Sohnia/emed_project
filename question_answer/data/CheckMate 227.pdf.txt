BACKGROUND
Nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed promising eff icacy for the treatment of non– small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a phase 1 trial, and tumor mutational burden has  emerged as a potential biomarker of benef it. In this part of an open-label, multipart,  phase 3 trial, we examined progression-free survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  versus chemotherapy among patients with a high tumor mutational burden (≥10 muta- tions per megabase).
METHODS
We enrolled patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC that was not previously treated  with chemotherapy. Those with a level of tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)  expression of at least 1% were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive nivolum- ab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab monotherapy, or chemotherapy; those with a tumor  PD-L1 expression level of less than 1% were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to  receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy.  Tumor mutational burden was determined by the FoundationOne CDx assay.
RESULTS
Progression-free survival among patients with a high tumor mutational burden was  signif icantly longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy. The  1-year progression-free survival rate was 42.6% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus  13.2% with chemotherapy, and the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months  (95% conf idence interval [CI], 5.5 to 13.2) versus 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.4 to 5.8) (hazard  ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 97.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.81; P<0.001). The objective  response rate was 45.3% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 26.9% with chemotherapy.  The benef it of nivolumab plus ipilimumab over chemotherapy was broadly consistent  within subgroups, including patients with a PD-L1 expression level of at least 1% and  those with a level of less than 1%. The rate of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse  events was 31.2% with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 36.1% with chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS
Progression-free survival was signif icantly longer with f irst-line nivolumab plus ipilimu- mab than with chemotherapy among patients with NSCLC and a high tumor muta- tional burden, irrespective of PD-L1 expression level. The results validate the benef it  of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in NSCLC and the role of tumor mutational burden as  a biomarker for patient selection.

Standard-of-care therapy for previ- ously untreated advanced non–small-cell  lung cancer (NSCLC) without treatable driver  mutat ions includes plat inum-based chemother- apy1,2 and pembrolizumab for pat ients with a  high level (≥50%) of tumor programmed death  ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.3 There remains a  need for more ef fect ive f irst-line treatments for  the majorit y of pat ients with advanced NSCLC  and for predict ive biomarkers to ident if y pa- t ients who may benef it from new therapies.3,4 Nivolumab, an ant i–programmed death 1  (PD-1) ant ibody, and ipilimumab, an ant i–cyto- toxic T-lymphocyte ant igen 4 (CTLA-4) ant ibody,  are immune checkpoint inhibitors with comple- mentar y mechanisms of act ion. Results of a  phase 1 trial evaluat ing nivolumab plus ipilimu- mab as f irst-line treatment for NSCLC showed  mainly expected adverse events and suggested  greater ef f icacy of the combinat ion as compared  with nivolumab monotherapy.5 Tumor mutational burden is an emerging, in- dependent biomarker of outcomes with immuno- therapy in mult iple tumor t ypes, including lung  cancer.6-16 Analyses from the CheckMate 568 trial,  a phase 2 trial of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in  NSCLC, ident if ied a tumor mutat ional burden of  at least 10 mutat ions per megabase as an ef fec- t ive cutof f for select ing pat ients most likely to  have a response, irrespect ive of tumor PD-L1  expression level.17 CheckMate 227 is an open-label phase 3 trial  evaluating multiple hypotheses regarding the ef- f icacy of nivolumab or nivolumab-based regimens  as f irst-line treatment in biomarker-selected pop- ulat ions of pat ients with advanced NSCLC. On  the basis of the emerging data related to tumor  mutat iona l burden, the CheckMate 227 t ria l  protocol (ava ilable with the full text of this  ar t icle at NEJM.org) was amended to add a  coprimar y end point eva luat ing progression- free sur viva l with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  versus chemotherapy among pat ients with a tu- mor mutat ional burden of at least 10 mutat ions  per megabase, irrespect ive of PD-L1 expression  level. Here we report the f indings for this copri- mar y end point.

Patients
Adult patients with histologically conf irmed squa- mous or nonsquamous stage IV or recurrent 
NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperat ive Oncolog y  Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 or 1  (on a scale of 0 to 5, with higher scores indicat- ing greater disability)18 who had received no previ- ous systemic anticancer therapy as primary ther- apy for advanced or metastat ic disease were  eligible. All the pat ients underwent imaging to  screen for brain metastases. Pat ients with known  EGFR mutat ions or ALK translocat ions sensit ive  to targeted therapy, an autoimmune disease, or  untreated central nervous system metastases were  excluded. Pat ients with cent ra l ner vous system  metastases were eligible if they were adequately  treated and neurologic f indings had returned to  baseline (except for residual signs or symptoms  related to the central ner vous system treatment)  for at least 2 weeks before randomizat ion.

Trial Design and Treatment
The CheckMate 227 trial is a mult ipart phase 3  t ria l designed to eva luate dif ferent nivolumab- based regimens versus chemotherapy in dist inct  pat ient populat ions. This art icle focuses on part  1 of the trial. We enrolled pat ients with a tumor  PD-L1 expression level of at least 1% and those  with a level of less than 1% contemporaneously at  the same centers (Fig. 1). Patients with a PD-L1  expression level of at least 1% were randomly  assigned (in a 1:1:1 rat io), with st rat if icat ion  according to tumor histologic t ype (squamous  vs. nonsquamous), to receive nivolumab (3 mg  per kilogram of body weight ever y 2 weeks) plus  ipilimumab (1 mg per kilogram ever y 6 weeks),  plat inum doublet chemotherapy based on tumor  histologic type every 3 weeks for up to four cycles,  or nivolumab (240 mg ever y 2 weeks). Pat ients  with a PD-L1 expression level of less than 1%  were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1 rat io), with  strat if icat ion according to tumor histologic t ype,  to receive nivolumab (3 mg per k ilogram ever y  2 weeks) plus ipilimumab (1 mg per kilogram  ever y 6 weeks), plat inum doublet chemotherapy  based on tumor histologic t ype ever y 3 weeks for  up to four cycles, or nivolumab (360 mg) plus  plat inum doublet chemotherapy based on tumor  histologic t ype ever y 3 weeks for up to four  cycles. Pat ients with nonsquamous NSCLC who  had stable disease or a response af ter four cy- cles of chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus  nivolumab could cont inue with ma intenance

End Points and Assessments
Part 1 of the CheckMate 227 trial had two copri- mar y end points. One coprimar y end point was  progression-free sur viva l (assessed by blinded  independent central review) with nivolumab plus  ipilimumab versus chemotherapy in a pat ient

populat ion selected on the basis of tumor muta- t iona l burden. On the basis of previous f ind- ings,17 a prespecif ied cutof f for tumor muta- t iona l burden of at least 10 mutat ions per  megabase was selected for preplanned analysis  of the coprimar y end point. The other coprimar y  end point was overa ll sur viva l with nivolumab  plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy in a patient  populat ion selected on the basis of the PD-L1  expression level. Secondar y end points in pat ient populat ions  selected on the basis of tumor mutational burden  included progression-free survival with nivolumab  versus chemotherapy among pat ients with a tu- mor mutat ional burden of at least 13 mutat ions  per megabase and a PD-L1 expression level of at  least 1% and overa ll sur viva l with nivolumab  plus ipilimumab versus platinum doublet chemo- therapy among pat ients with a tumor mutat ional  burden of at least 10 mutat ions per megabase  (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The  cutof f for tumor mutat ional burden of at least 13  mutat ions per megabase for the secondar y end  point of progression-free survival with nivolumab  versus chemotherapy was based on analyses from  the CheckMate 026 t ria l, including a bridging  study convert ing mutat ion data obta ined by  whole-exome sequencing to mutat ion data ob- tained by the Foundat ionOne CDx assay.13,19 Re- sponse rate, durat ion of response, and safet y  were explorator y end points. Adverse events were  graded according to the Nat ional Cancer Inst i- tute Common Terminolog y Criteria for Adverse  Events, version 4.0. Tumor PD-L1 expression  level was determined as described previously.20 Tumor mutat iona l burden, def ined as the  number of somat ic, coding base subst itut ions  and short insert ions and delet ions (indels) per  megabase of genome examined, was determined  by the Foundat ionOne CDx assay.21-23 The muta- t ion count after applicat ion of various f ilters was  divided by the region counted (0.8 Mb) to yield  mutat ions per megabase (for addit ional details,  see the Methods sect ion in the Supplementar y  Appendix).
Trial Oversight
The trial was designed and data were analyzed  joint ly by the sponsor (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and  a steering committee, with the part icipat ion of  individual authors. All the invest igators collect- ed data. The trial protocol was approved by the 
inst itut iona l review board or independent eth- ics commit tee at each center. The protocol was  amended on the basis of external evidence to  include tumor mutat ional burden–based ef f icacy  ana lyses on October 5, 2017, af ter enrollment  had been completed but before the database lock  and breaking of the coded treatments. The trial  was conducted in accordance with the Interna- t ional Conference on Harmonisat ion Good Clin- ica l Pract ice guidelines and the Declarat ion of  Helsink i. An independent data and safet y mon- itoring commit tee provided oversight of safet y  and ef f icacy. This init ial report is based on a f inal analysis  of progression-free survival data from the patient  populat ion selected on the basis of tumor muta- t ional burden (database lock, Januar y 24, 2018).  On the basis of an interim analysis for overall  sur viva l, the data and safet y monitoring com- mit tee recommended that the t ria l cont inue.  Therefore, overa ll sur viva l data, including re- sults for the overa ll sur viva l coprimar y end  point, are not included in this repor t. A ll the  authors at test that the t ria l was conducted in  accordance with the protocol and vouch for the  accuracy and completeness of the data and analy- ses. The manuscript was prepared with profes- siona l medica l-writ ing assistance funded by the  sponsor.
S tatis tic al Analysis
For the coprimar y end point of progression-free  sur vival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus  chemotherapy among pat ients with a tumor mu- tat iona l burden of at least 10 mutat ions per  megabase, we est imated that a sample of at least  265 pat ients with approx imately 221 events of  death or disease progression would provide 80%  power for the t ria l to detect a hazard rat io of  0.66 favoring nivolumab plus ipilimumab over  chemotherapy, with a two-sided t ype I error of  0.025, by means of a log-rank test. Hazard rat ios  for disease progression or death with associated  two-sided conf idence inter va ls were est imated  with the use of an unstrat if ied Cox proport ional- hazards model, with treatment group as a single  covariate. A mult ivariate analysis was prespeci- f ied involving pat ients with a tumor mutat ional  burden of at least 10 mutat ions per megabase to  assess the inf luence of known prognost ic base- line factors on progression-free sur viva l.

Patients and Treatment
Of 2877 pat ients enrolled in part 1 of the trial  from August 2015 through November 2016, 1739  underwent randomizat ion. Of the 1138 pat ients  who did not undergo randomizat ion, 909 no  longer met the trial criteria (common reasons  included the ident if icat ion of EGFR or ALK muta- t ions, a decline in performance status, untreated  brain metastases, and missing data on PD-L1  expression level), 88 withdrew consent, 40 died,  33 had adverse events (unrelated to a trial drug),  6 were lost to follow-up, and 62 were excluded  for other reasons (Fig. S1 in the Supplementar y  Appendix). Of the 1739 randomly assigned pat ients, 1649  (94.8%) had tumor samples available to attempt  assessment of tumor mutat ional burden, and  1004 (57.7%) had valid data for tumor muta- t ional burden–based ef f icacy analyses (Table S2  in the Supplementar y Appendix). Baseline char- acterist ics of all randomly assigned pat ients and  pat ients whose tumor mutat ional burden could  be evaluated were similar and balanced between  treatment groups (Table S3 in the Supplemen- tar y Appendix). Of the 1004 pat ients whose tumor mutat ional  burden could be evaluated across all treatment  groups, 444 (44.2%) had at least 10 mutat ions  per megabase, including 139 pat ients assigned  to nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 160 pat ients  assigned to chemotherapy. Baseline character- ist ics were well ba lanced between the two  t reatment groups, including the dist ribut ion of  PD-L1 expression levels (Table 1). In the popu- lat ion of pat ients whose tumor mutat ional bur- den could be eva luated, there was no correla- t ion between tumor mutat iona l burden and  PD-L1 expression level (Fig. S2 in the Supple- mentar y Appendix).
*  A high tumor mutational burden was defined as at least 10 mutations per  megabase. No significant differences between treatment groups were noted  for the baseline characteristics. Percentages may not total 100 because of  rounding. PD-L1 denotes programmed death ligand 1. †  Included are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Israel, Lebanon,  Mexico, Peru, Turkey, and South Africa. ‡  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status scores range  from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater disability. Two patients (one  in each group) with a score of 1 at screening had an increase in the score be- tween screening and the baseline evaluation at the time of the first dose.

therapy cont inued to receive treatment (Table S4  in the Supplementar y Appendix). The median  durat ion of therapy was 4.2 months (range, 0.03  to 24.0+ [plus signs indicate ongoing status at  the t ime of database lock]) with nivolumab plus  ipilimumab and 2.6 months (range, 0.03 to 22.1+)  with chemotherapy. The median number of doses  of nivolumab (ever y 2 weeks) and ipilimumab  (ever y 6 weeks) received as combinat ion therapy  was 9 (range, 1 to 53) and 3 (range, 1 to 18),  respect ively.
Patients with a High Tumor Mutational Burden
Among pat ients with a high tumor mutat iona l  burden (≥10 mutat ions per megabase), 24.4%  t reated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and  3.1% treated with chemotherapy were continuing  treatment at the t ime of database lock; the most  common reasons for discont inuing t reatment  were disease progression (37.8% and 47.2%, re- spect ively), adverse ef fects of trial drugs (25.9%  and 8.8%, respect ively), and complet ion of re- quired t reatment among pat ients in the chemo- therapy group (26.4%) (Table S4 in the Supple- mentar y Appendix). Of pat ients assigned to  chemotherapy, 30.0% received subsequent im- munotherapy (Table S5 in the Supplementar y  Appendix).
Effic acy All Randomly Assigned Patients
Among all randomly assigned pat ients (irrespec- tive of tumor mutational burden or PD-L1 expres- sion level), the 1-year progression-free sur vival  rate was higher with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  than with chemotherapy (30.9% vs. 17.0%; haz- ard rat io for disease progression or death, 0.83;  95% conf idence inter val [CI], 0.72 to 0.96). The  median progression-free sur vival was 4.9 months  (95% CI, 4.1 to 5.6) with nivolumab plus ipilimu- mab and 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 5.6) with  chemotherapy. Similarly, longer progression-free  sur viva l with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than  with chemotherapy was seen among pat ients  whose tumor mutat ional burden could be evalu- ated (hazard rat io for disease progression or  death, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.99), with 1-year  progression-free sur vival rates of 32.1% versus  15.2%; the median progression-free sur vival was  4.9 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.7) and 5.5 months  (95% CI, 4.6 to 5.6), respect ively (Fig. S3 in the  Supplementar y Appendix).
Patients with a High Tumor Mutational Burden
Analysis of the coprimar y end point in pat ients  with a high tumor mutational burden (≥10 muta- t ions per megabase) showed signif icant ly longer  progression-free sur viva l with nivolumab plus  ipilimumab than with chemotherapy; the 1-year  progression-free sur vival rate was 42.6% versus  13.2%, and the median progression-free sur vival  was 7.2 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 13.2) versus 5.5  months (95% CI, 4.4 to 5.8) (hazard rat io for  disease progression or death, 0.58; 97.5% CI,  0.41 to 0.81; P<0.001) (Fig. 2A). In a prespecif ied  mult ivariate analysis of progression-free sur vival  among pat ients with a high tumor mutat iona l  burden, the t reatment ef fect of nivolumab plus  ipilimumab versus chemotherapy with adjustment  for baseline PD-L1 expression level (≥1% vs. <1%),  sex, tumor histologic t ype (squamous vs. non- squamous), and ECOG performance-status score  (0 vs. ≥1) was consistent with that in the pri- mar y progression-free sur vival analysis (hazard  rat io for disease progression or death, 0.57;  97.5% CI, 0.40 to 0.80; P<0.001 by mult ivariate  Cox model). The response rate was 45.3% with  nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 26.9% with che- motherapy (Table 2). The percentage of pat ients  with a response who had an ongoing response  after 1 year was 68% with nivolumab plus ipilim- umab and 25% with chemotherapy (Fig. 2B).
Patients with a Low Tumor Mutational Burden
Among pat ients with a low tumor mutat iona l  burden (<10 mutat ions per megabase), the me- dian progression-free sur viva l was 3.2 months  (95% CI, 2.7 to 4.3) with nivolumab plus ipilimu- mab and 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.6) with  chemotherapy. The between-group difference was  not signif icant (hazard rat io for disease progres- sion or death, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.35) (Fig. S4  in the Supplementary Appendix).
Selected Subgroups of Patients with a High Tumor  Mutational Burden
Subgroup ana lysis among pat ients with a high  tumor mutat iona l burden according to PD-L1  status showed that progression-free sur vival was  longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than  with chemotherapy among pat ients with a PD-L1  expression level of at least 1% and those with a  level of less than 1% (Fig. 3A).

Nivolumab Monotherapy
A secondar y end point of the trial was the ef f i- cacy of nivolumab (71 pat ients) versus chemo- therapy (79 pat ients) among pat ients with a tu- mor mutat ional burden of at least 13 mutat ions  per megabase and a PD-L1 expression level of at  least 1% (pat ients with a PD-L1 expression level  of <1% were not eligible to receive nivolumab).  There was no signif icant dif ference in progres- sion-free sur viva l between the two t reatment  groups in this pat ient populat ion; the median  progression-free sur vival was 4.2 months (95%  CI, 2.7 to 8.3) with nivolumab and 5.6 months  (95% CI, 4.5 to 7.0) with chemotherapy (hazard  rat io for disease progression or death, 0.95;  97.5% CI, 0.61 to 1.48; P = 0.78) (Fig. S5 in the  Supplementary Appendix). Among pat ients with  a tumor mutat ional burden of at least 10 muta- t ions per megabase and a PD-L1 expression level  of at least 1%, the median progression-free sur- vival was 7.1 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 13.5) with  nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 4.2 months  (95% CI, 2.6 to 8.3) with nivolumab monotherapy  (hazard rat io for disease progression or death,  0.75; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.07) (Fig. S6 in the Supple- mentary Appendix).
Safet y
Safety summaries for nivolumab plus ipilimumab,  nivolumab monotherapy, and chemotherapy in all  t reated pat ients are shown in Table 3. The rates  of adverse events that were considered by the  invest igator to be t reatment-related, including  events of grade 3 or 4, were similar in the  nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and the chemo- therapy group. Treatment-related adverse events  leading to discont inuat ion were more common  with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with che- motherapy (17.4% vs. 8.9%); however, pat ients  cont inued to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab  longer than chemotherapy. The rate of treatment- related adverse events leading to discont inuat ion  of nivolumab monotherapy (11.5%) was consis- tent with previous obser vat ions.17 The most  common treatment-related select adverse events 
(def ined as adverse events of potent ial immuno- logic causes) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab  and nivolumab monotherapy were skin react ions  (33.9% and 20.7%, respect ively); the most com- mon grade 3 or 4 t reatment-related select ad- verse events were hepat ic events (8.0% and 3.3%,  respect ively) (Fig. S7 in the Supplementar y Ap- pendix). Overall, treatment-related deaths occurred in

*  A high tumor mutational burden was defined as at least 10 mutations per megabase. Data are based on a January 24,  2018, database lock. Plus signs indicate ongoing response at the time of database lock. NR denotes not reached. †  Objective response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1,24 by  blinded independent central review. The 95% confidence interval is based on the Clopper–Pearson method. The un- weighted difference in objective response rates between the treatment groups was determined by the method of  Newcombe. ‡  The analysis was performed with data from all the patients who had a response (63 patients in the nivolumab-plus-  ipilimumab group and 43 in the chemotherapy group). §  The time to response was defined as the time from randomization to the date of first documented complete or partial  response. ¶  Results were calculated with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method. The duration of response was defined as the time  between the date of first response and the date of first documented event of progression, death, or last tumor assess- ment that was evaluated before subsequent therapy (data-censoring date).
seven pat ients (1.2%) t reated with nivolumab  plus ipilimumab (three died from pneumonit is  and one each died from myocardit is, acute tubu- lar necrosis, circulator y collapse, and cardiac  tamponade), six pat ients (1.1%) t reated with  chemotherapy (two died from sepsis and one  each died from mult iple brain infarct ions, inter- st it ia l lung disease, thrombocy topenia, and fe- brile neutropenia with sepsis), and two pat ients  (0.5%) t reated with nivolumab (one each died  from pneumonit is and neutropenia with sepsis).  (For addit iona l deta ils on safet y, see Tables S6  through S10 in the Supplementar y Appendix.)  Rates of treatment-related adverse events with  nivolumab plus ipilimumab were slight ly higher 
among pat ients with a tumor mutat ional burden  of at least 10 mutat ions per megabase than  among a ll t reated pat ients (Table S10 in the  Supplementar y Appendix).
D i s c u s s i on
The results of this t ria l show that in pat ients  with advanced NSCLC and a tumor mutat iona l  burden of at least 10 mutat ions per megabase,  f irst-line treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimu- mab was associated with longer progression-free  sur vival than chemotherapy. The benef it of com- binat ion immunotherapy was durable, with 43%  of pat ients being progression-free at 1 year (vs.

Among pat ients  with a high tumor mutat iona l burden, we ob- ser ved a benef it of nivolumab plus ipilimumab  in pat ients with a tumor PD-L1 expression level  of at least 1% and those with a level of less than  1%, as well as in pat ients with a squamous tu- mor histologic t ype and those with a nonsqua- mous t ype, and the benef it was consistent across  the majority of other subgroups. Although longer 
progression-free sur vival was seen with nivolu- mab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy  among all randomly assigned pat ients, a tumor  mutat ional burden of at least 10 mutat ions per  megabase was an ef fect ive biomarker. The bene- f it with nivolumab plus ipilimumab was part icu- larly enhanced in pat ients with a high tumor  mutat iona l burden, whereas progression-free  sur viva l was similar in the nivolumab-plus-  ipilimumab and chemotherapy groups among  pat ients with a low tumor mutat iona l burden

(<10 mutat ions per megabase). In addit ion,  nivolumab plus ipilimumab had bet ter ef f icacy  than nivolumab monotherapy in pat ients with a  tumor mutat iona l burden of at least 10 muta- t ions per megabase, a f inding that highlights  the dist inct importance of dua l immune check- point blockade in NSCLC with a high tumor  mutat ional burden. The trial cont inues for the  coprimar y end point of overa ll sur viva l among  pat ients selected on the basis of PD-L1 expres- sion level. Tumor mutat ional burden and PD-L1 expres- sion level were independent biomarkers in the  CheckMate 227 t ria l, f indings consistent with  those of previous reports. Among pat ients with  a high tumor mutat ional burden, the benef it of  nivolumab plus ipilimumab over chemotherapy  was similar in pat ients with a PD-L1 expression  level of at least 1% and those with a level of less  than 1%. Therefore, nivolumab plus ipilimumab  may represent an ef fect ive treatment regimen for 
pat ients with a high tumor mutat ional burden,  irrespect ive of PD-L1 expression level. Data on the safet y of nivolumab plus ipilimu- mab were consistent with previously repor ted  data on f irst-line t reatment of NSCLC. In the  CheckMate 012 t ria l, various dosing regimens  of nivolumab plus ipilimumab were eva luated  in eight cohor ts, and the regimen of 3 mg of  nivolumab per kilogram ever y 2 weeks plus 1 mg  of ipilimumab per k ilogram ever y 6 weeks was  associated with mainly low-grade adverse events  and was ef fect ive.5 These f indings were con- f irmed in our large, internat iona l t ria l, with  no new safet y signa ls obser ved with the com- binat ion. Important questions remain regarding the role  of immunotherapy combinat ions versus immu- notherapy–chemotherapy combinat ions, the pre- ferred sequencing of therapies, whether tumor  mutat iona l burden can be used to ident if y pa- t ients who may derive benef it from immuno-

therapy–chemotherapy combinations, and whether  a clinica lly useful cutof f for tumor mutat iona l  burden can be ident if ied for nivolumab mono- therapy. The rate of 58% for obtaining results for  tumor mutat ional burden that we report in this  trial was due mainly to the limited availabilit y of  tumor samples of suf f icient quant it y or qualit y,  a consequence of limited t issue requested for  biomarker analysis as part of the trial. In clinical  pract ice, when a test of mutat iona l burden is  requested early during the decision-making pro- cess for select ing the most appropriate f irst-line  t reatment and thus a suf f icient quant it y and  qua lit y of tumor samples can be obta ined and  submitted, successful determinat ion of tumor  mutat ional burden can be expected for 80% to  95% of pat ients undergoing test ing.21 Whether  circulat ing tumor DNA could provide a noninva- sive method for assessing tumor mutat iona l  burden is not yet clear. In conclusion, progression-free sur vival was  signif icant ly longer with nivolumab plus ipilimu-
mab than with chemotherapy among pat ients  with advanced NSCLC and a tumor mutat iona l  burden of at least 10 mutat ions per megabase,  irrespect ive of tumor PD-L1 expression level.  Safet y was consistent with previous f indings  for nivolumab plus low-dose ipilimumab.5 These  results va lidate the role of nivolumab plus ipi- limumab as an ef fect ive f irst-line therapy in  NSCLC and tumor mutat ional burden as an im- portant and independent biomarker in advanced  NSCLC.
