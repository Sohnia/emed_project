Summary
Background In the ongoing, phase 3 PACIFIC trial, durvalumab improved the primary endpoints of progression-free  survival and overall survival compared with that for placebo, with similar safety, in patients with unresectable, stage III  non-small-cell lung cancer. In this analysis, we aimed to evaluate one of the secondary endpoints, patient-reported  outcomes (PROs).
Methods PACIFIC is an ongoing, international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.  Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years, had a WHO performance status of 0 or 1, with histologically or cytologically  documented stage III, unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer, for which they had received at least two cycles of  platinum-based chemoradiotherapy, with no disease progression after this treatment. We randomly assigned patients  (2:1) using an interactive voice response system and a blocked design (block size=3) stratified by age, sex, and smoking  history to receive 10 mg/kg intravenous durvalumab or matching placebo 1–42 days after concurrent chemoradiotherapy,  then every 2 weeks up to 12 months. The primary endpoints of progression-free survival and overall survival have  been reported previously. PROs were a prespecified secondary outcome. We assessed PRO symptoms, functioning,  and global health status or quality of life in the intention-to-treat population with the European Organisation for  Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) version 3 and its lung  cancer module, the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13) at the time of random allocation to  groups, at weeks 4 and 8, every 8 weeks until week 48, and then every 12 weeks until progression. Changes from  baseline to 12 month in key symptoms were analysed with mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) and time-to- event analyses. A 10-point or greater change from baseline (deterioration or improvement) was deemed clinically  relevant. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02125461, and EudraCT, 2014-000336-42.
Findings Between May 9, 2014, and April 22, 2016, 476 patients were assigned to receive durvalumab, and 237 patients  were assigned to receive placebo. As of March 22, 2018, the median follow-up was 25·2 months (IQR 14·1–29·5).  More than 79% of patients given durvalumab and more than 82% of patients given placebo completed questionnaires  up to week 48. Between baseline and 12 months, the prespecified longitudinal PROs of interest, cough (MMRM- adjusted mean change 1·8 [95% CI 0·06 to 3·54] in the durvalumab group vs 0·7 [–1·91 to 3·30] in the placebo  group), dyspnoea (3·1 [1·75 to 4·36] vs 1·4 [–0·51 to 3·34]), chest pain (–3·1 [–4·57 to –1·60] vs –3·5 [–5·68 to –1·29]),  fatigue (–3·0 [–4·53 to –1·50] vs –5·2 [–7·45 to –2·98]), appetite loss (–5·8 [–7·28 to –4·36] vs –7·0 [–9·17 to –4·87]),  physical functioning (0·1 [–1·10 to 1·28] vs 2·0 [0·22 to 3·73]), and global health status or quality of life (2·6  [1·21 to 3·94] vs 1·8 [–0·25 to 3·81]) remained stable with both treatments, with no clinically relevant changes from  baseline. The between-group differences in changes from baseline to 12 months in cough (difference in adjusted  mean changes 1·1, 95% CI –1·89 to 4·11), dyspnoea (1·6, –0·58 to 3·87), chest pain (0·4, –2·13 to 2·93), fatigue (2·2,  –0·38 to 4·78), appetite loss (1·2, –1·27 to 3·67), physical functioning (–1·9, –3·91 to 0·15), or global health status or  quality of life (0·8, –1·55 to 3·14) were not clinically relevant. Generally, there were no clinically important between- group differences in time to deterioration of prespecified key PRO endpoints.
Interpretation Our findings suggest that a clinical benefit with durvalumab can be attained without compromising  PROs. This result is of note because the previous standard of care was observation alone, with no presumed detriment  to PROs.

Introduction
Non-small-cell lung cancer accounts for more than 80%  of all cases of lung cancer worldwide, which is a leading 
cause of cancer-related deaths.1,2 Patients with non- small-cell lung cancer often present with advanced  disease and approximately a third of patients present

Research in context
Evidence before this study We searched PubMed for reports published in English between  Jan 1, 2010, and Feb 8, 2019, with the search terms “advanced  non-small-cell lung cancer” and “patient-reported outcomes”  (PRO) or “health-related quality of life”, and we limited our  results to studies of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies. Evidence  regarding the effect of immunotherapy on PROs in patients with  advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer is emerging.  For example, pembrolizumab improved health-related quality of  life, symptoms, and function, and delayed time to deterioration  in chest symptoms compared with platinum-based doublet  chemotherapy in treatment-naive patients with stage IV  non-small-cell lung cancer whose tumours showed a high  expression of PD-L1 (≥50%; KEYNOTE-024 study). Similar  improvements in quality of life over chemotherapy were  reported in other studies of anti-PD-1 drugs; improvements have  been found with nivolumab in patients with advanced  non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (CheckMate 057) and  squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (CheckMate 017),  with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced PD-L1- expressing non-small-cell lung cancer (KEYNOTE-010), and with  atezolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic  non-small-cell lung cancer (OAK). To our knowledge, there have  been no PRO data reported for immunotherapies in patients  with unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer to date.
Added value of this study In our trial (PACIFIC ), durvalumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody)  increased progression-free survival and overall survival 
(the primary endpoints) compared with placebo in patients  with stage III, locally advanced, unresectable non-small-cell  lung cancer who had not progressed after two or more cycles  of platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy.  The addition of up to 12 months of durvalumab treatment did  not compromise patients’ symptoms, functioning, or global  health status or quality of life compared with placebo during  the study period, complementing previous efficacy and safety  findings and further establishing the PACIFIC regimen  (durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy) as a  standard of care.
Implications of all the available evidence The findings of improved progression-free survival and  overall survival during PACIFIC suggest that durvalumab  represents a new standard of care in patients with locally  advanced, unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer, as  reflected by its inclusion in the National Comprehensive  Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines and regulatory  approvals in the USA, Europe, Japan, and other regions. PRO  data from PACIFIC further suggest that clinical benefit with  durvalumab can be attained without compromising patients’  quality of life, which is notable because the previous standard  of care was observation alone, with no presumed detriment  to PROs.
with stage III, locally advanced tumours.3 The standard  of care for patients with unresectable, stage III non- small-cell lung cancer was previously platinum-based  concurrent chemoradiotherapy.1 Patients who respond  to concurrent chemoradiotherapy are then typically  monitored for disease progression.4 However, the  prognosis for patients receiving concurrent chemo- radiotherapy is poor, with a median progression-free  survival of approximately 8 months and between 15%  and 30% of patients showing 5-year survival.3,5–7 Previous  trials5,8–11 have shown no benefit of systemic therapy with  curative intent chemoradiotherapy after stable disease,  high lighting the unmet clinical need for an efficacious  treatment for unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung  cancer. At the first interim analysis12 of the PACIFIC study,  durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, significantly  improved the primary endpoint of progression-free  survival compared with that for placebo (median  16·8 months vs 5·6 months; stratified hazard ratio [HR]  0·52; 95% CI 0·42–0·65; p<0·0001). Durvalumab also  had a manageable safety profile, which was consistent  with that of other immunotherapies. These data formed  the basis for subsequent approvals of durvalumab as a 
treatment for patients with unresectable, stage III  non-small-cell lung cancer whose disease had not  progressed following platinum-based chemoradiotherapy.  We also reported the findings of the second primary  endpoint, overall survival.13 Durvalumab significantly  improved overall survival compared with that for placebo  (not reached vs 28·7 months; 0·68; 99·73% CI  0·47–0·997; p=0·0025). Improved survival is an important endpoint, but this  endpoint is not the only measure of benefit. Although  safety endpoints provide evidence for treatment toxicity,  they are assessed directly by clinical investigators  and they do not provide insight into subjective patient  experience. Therefore, patient-reported  outcomes  (PROs), which reflect patients’ perspective of their  symptoms, functioning, and health-related quality of life,  can provide important complementary data to efficacy  and safety endpoints. This outcome is particularly  important because the previous standard of care was  observation alone, with no therapeutic intervention for  which there is no presumed detriment to PROs. Patient- focused drug development and the use of PROs are  priorities of the US Food and Drug Administration’s new  Oncology Center of Excellence.

We aimed to evaluate the PROs in the phase 3 PACIFIC  study, particularly detailing the effects of durvalumab  versus placebo on patients’ symptoms, functioning, and  global health status (ie, quality of life).
Methods
Study design and participants
PACIFIC is an ongoing, international, multicentre,  double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial. The  primary and secondary endpoints of this phase 3 trial  have been reported previously.12,13 This was a global trial,  conducted at 235 cancer treatment centres across 26  countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, north and south  America, and south Africa. A full list of the study sites is  provided in the appendix (pp 12–21). Patients were eligible if they had histologically or  cytologically documented stage III, unresectable non- small-cell  lung cancer, as per  the International  Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Staging Manual  in Thoracic Oncology (version 7), and had received at  least two cycles of platinum-based chemoradiotherapy,  with no disease progression after this treatment. Eligible  patients were aged at least 18 years, had a WHO  performance status of 0 or 1, an estimated life expectancy  of at least 12 weeks, and had completed the last radiation  dose within the past 1–14 days (which became 1–42 days  after a protocol amendment on Feb 18, 2015, after the  trial had begun) before randomisation. Key exclusion criteria were previous exposure to anti- PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies; receipt of immunotherapy  or an investigational drug within 4 weeks before the first  dose of durvalumab (or 6 weeks for monoclonal anti- bodies); evidence of uncontrolled, concurrent illness or  ongoing or active infections; active or previous auto- immune disease (within the past 2 years) or primary  immunodeficiency history; and unresolved toxicity from  previous chemoradiotherapy at a severity of more than  grade 2 (as per Common Terminology Criteria for  Adverse Events) or pneumonitis of at least grade 2. Full  inclusion and exclusion criteria are in the appendix  (pp 78–83). All patients provided written, informed consent for  participation in the study. The study protocol and  amendments were approved by relevant local or central  ethics com mittees, and the study was performed in  accordance with  the International Conference on  Harmonisation Guidelines on Good Clinical Practice  and the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol is provided  in the appendix (pp 22–231).
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (2:1)  to receive  durvalumab or matching placebo 1−42 days after  chemoradiotherapy. An interactive voice response system  was used to assign unique enrolment numbers to each  patient. Randomisation was done with a blocked design  (block size=3) that resulted in one randomisation list for 
each of the randomisation strata, and all centres used the  same  list to minimise between-group  imbalances.  Patients were stratified by age (<65 vs ≥65 years), sex  (male vs female), and smoking history (current or former  smoker vs never smoked). The principal investigator or a  suitably trained delegate (RH, MÖ, AV, DD, DV, SM, TY,  AC, KHL, MdW, BCC, JEG, or SJA) enrolled the patients  at each study site. The patients, investigators, and study  centre staff were masked to study drug allocation via  opaque sleeves fastened with tamper-evident tape over  the intravenous bags and colour-matched reconstituted  intravenous solutions. However,  the study centre  pharmacist was not masked to groups, such that they  could prepare durvalumab or placebo for each patient as  specified by the randomisation schedule.
Procedures
Patients provided archived tumour tissue samples for  PD-L1 testing if available; however, enrolment was  not restricted to any PD-L1 expression thresholds.  Patients received 10 mg/kg intravenous durvalumab  (AstraZeneca; Wilmington, DE, USA) or matching  placebo, every 2 weeks for up to 12 months. Dose  reductions were not permitted. Dose delays, inter- ruptions, or discontinuation were allowed for manage- ment of toxicity, as defined in the protocol (appendix  pp 210–31). Patients who had a dose interruption because  of toxicity at any time during the first 12 months of  treatment could resume treatment, but the treatment  period could not exceed 12 months (including the  interruption time). Study drug could be discontinued  because of confirmed progression, initiation of an  alternative anticancer therapy, unacceptable toxicity, or  withdrawal of consent. Patients could be treated with  their study drug during progression if they fulfilled  predefined criteria, and treatment could resume if  disease control was achieved at the end of 12 months and  the disease progressed during follow-up. PROs were assessed with paper-based questionnaires at  the time of random allocation to groups, week 4, week 8,  every 8 weeks until week 48, then every 12 weeks until  disease progression. The last assessment for patients  who discontinued treatment because of pro gression was  day 30 after the final dose. Patients who continued  treatment after progression because of clinical benefit, at  the  investigator’s discretion, continued completing  question naires for as long as they received treatment.  Patients who discontinued treatment for reasons other  than confirmed progression continued completing the  question naires until confirmed progression. We evaluated patient-reported symptoms, functioning,  and global health status or quality of  life with  two questionnaires that were developed by the European  Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer  (EORTC) Study Group on quality of life: the Quality  of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) version 3  and its lung cancer module, the Quality of Life

ArticlesQuestionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13). We also  used the EuroQoL 5-dimension utility index (EQ-5D), a  standardised measure of health status that was developed  by the EuroQoL Group, as a prespecified exploratory  measure to assess the effects of treatment and disease  state on health status. EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3 is a 30-item core question- naire that consists of five multiple-item functioning  scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social);  one multiple-item global health status or quality of life  scale; three multiple-item symptom scales (fatigue, pain,  and nausea or vomiting); and six single-item measures  for dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation,  diarrhoea, and perceived financial difficulties.14 To assess additional symptoms associated with lung  cancer and its treatment, we used a complementary  13-item lung cancer module: the EORTC QLQ-LC13.15  This module consists of one multiple-item dyspnoea  scale and single-item measures for other lung cancer- associated symptoms (cough, haemoptysis, and site- specific pain in the chest, arm or shoulder, or other  body parts), pain medicine use, and side-effects  from conventional chemo radiotherapy (sore mouth,  dysphagia, neuropathy, and hair loss). This analysis  focuses on lung cancer-associated symptoms. QLQ-C30 was tested in interviews of patients with lung  cancer during development of the disease-specific lung  cancer module. Both QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 are widely  used in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung  cancer, and they have been well validated in psychometric  testing.14,15 The EQ-5D descriptive health system consists of  five dimensions of health: mobility, ability to care for  oneself, ability to undertake usual activities, pain and  discomfort, and anxiety and depression. The five-level  version of the questionnaire used in our study includes  five levels of severity for each dimension (no, slight,  moderate, severe, or extreme problems), which the  patient is asked to indicate for each dimension. The  questionnaire also includes a visual analogue scale, in  which the patient is asked to rate their current health  status on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst health  state and 100 the best.
Outcomes
The primary endpoints were progression-free survival  (as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors  version 1.1), which was assessed by blinded independent  central review, and overall survival.12,13 The prespecified  secondary endpoints were further efficacy outcomes (the  proportion of patients with an objective response,  duration of response, the proportion of patients alive and  progression free at 12 months and 18 months after  random assignment to groups, and time to death or  distant metastasis, all of which were assessed by blinded  independent central review; and overall survival at  24 months and time between random assignment and 
second progression); safety and tolerability (in which  adverse events were graded with  the Common  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03);  PROs; pharmacokinetics; and immunogenicity. This  analysis represents the report on the secondary endpoint  PROs (ie, symptoms, functioning, and health-related  quality of life). Analyses by disease progression status  and data regarding financial difficulties or pain  medication will not be reported.
Statistical analysis
The study was powered for the two primary endpoints  (progression-free survival and overall survival) and  details of  the sample size have been reported  previously.12,13 Approximately 702 patients were required  to be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to obtain 458 progression- free survival events and 491 overall survival events for the  primary analyses. Assuming an HR of 0·67 for  progression-free survival and of 0·73 for overall survival,  then the study would have at least 95% power for the  progression-free survival endpoint and 85% power for  the overall survival endpoint, to detect a statistically  significant difference, with a 2·5% two-sided significance  level, adjusted for interim analyses for each endpoint. The analysis of data on PROs in the intention-to-treat  population was a prespecified secondary endpoint.13 We  aimed to assess the effect of 12 months of treatment with  durvalumab versus placebo on PROs. We calculated  scores on the basis of scoring manuals or guidelines, and  scores ranged from 0 to 100. Higher scores on symptom  scales and items represent greater symptom severity, and  higher scores on the global health status or quality of life  and functioning scales indicate better health status or  function. Times to deterioration of QLQ-C30 functional  scales and global health status or quality of life were  assessed in patients with baseline scores of at least 10.  Times to deterioration of QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13  symptom scales or items were assessed in patients with  baseline scores of 90 or less. A 10-point change or more  from baseline (either deterioration or improvement;  classified as a moderate change) in a scale or item was  deemed clinically relevant.16 We also made post-hoc comparisons of baseline  EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-C13 scores from this study  with baseline data from a reference group of unselected  patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (sourced from  the EORTC quality of life group’s Cross-Cultural Analysis  Project).17,18 We evaluated changes at each visit in key symptoms,  physical functioning, and global health status or quality  of life from baseline to 12 months with a mixed model for  repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. This model  assumes that PROs were collected at several visits and  allows for missing data. The MMRM included fixed,  categorical effects of treatment, visit, and treatment-by- visit interaction, age at randomisation, sex, and smoking  history, and continuous fixed covariates of baseline score

Longitudinal PRO  endpoints of interest comprised key symptoms (cough,  dyspnoea, and chest pain [all QLQ-LC13]; fatigue and  appetite loss [QLQ-C30]); and physical functioning and  global health status or quality of life (QLQ-C30). Time to deterioration was defined as the time from  random allocation to groups until the date of the first  clinically relevant deterioration (≥10-point increase for  symptoms; ≥10-point decrease for function items and  global health status or quality of life) or death, regardless  of whether the patient withdrew from the study treat- ment or received another anticancer therapy before  deterioration. Time to deterioration was analysed using a  stratified log rank test, stratified by age at randomisation,  sex, and smoking history. HR and 95% CIs were  estimated with a Cox proportional hazards model. We  identified time to deterioration of cough, dyspnoea, chest  pain, haemoptysis (all QLQ-LC13), and global health  status or quality of life (QLQ-C30) as primary PRO  endpoints, and we calculated 99% CIs for these data. To reduce possible bias from transient symptom  change (eg, temporary symptoms due to treatment side- effects or comorbidities), which might have confounded  symptom changes associated with disease progression,  we did an exploratory, post-hoc analysis of time to  deterioration. In this post-hoc analysis, clinically relevant  deterioration had to be confirmed at a next consecutive  timepoint after the first observation. In patients in  whom disease progression occurred after the first  timepoint at which deterioration was observed, patients  were still considered to have had a worsening event.  This conclusion was only reversed if there was a direct  contradiction at the next consecutive timepoint (ie, an  improvement or a deterioration of less than 10 points vs  baseline). The statistical methods used were identical to  those used in the prespecified analysis of time to  deterioration. As part of a prespecified analysis, we defined the  proportion of patients with  improvement as  the  percentage of patients with two consecutive assessments,  separated by at least 14 days, that showed clinically  relevant improvements from baseline (≥10-point decrease  for symptoms; ≥10-point increase for function items and  global health status or quality of life). Odds ratios (ORs)  and 95% CIs were calculated with logistic regression,  which was adjusted for study  treatment, age at  randomisation, sex, and smoking history. Descriptive statistics are reported for the exploratory  EQ-5D index and EQ-visual analogue scale scores. SAS  (version 9.2) was used for all analyses. An independent  data monitoring committee oversaw the study. This study  is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02125461, and  EudraCT, 2014-000336-42.

Results
Between May 7, 2014, and April 22, 2016, we screened  983 patients for the trial, of whom 270 (27%) patients were  excluded because they did not meet eligibility criteria  (n=225), did not consent to be included (n=35), died (n=6),  or for other reasons (n=4; figure 1). Between May 9, 2014,  and April 22, 2016, we randomly assigned 713 (73%) patients  to groups. 476 (67%) patients were assigned to receive  durvalumab, of whom 473 (99%) patients received the  drug, and 237 (33%) patients were assigned to receive  placebo, of whom 236 (>99%) patients received placebo.  Three patients in the durvalumab group (two who  withdrew consent and one who developed neutropenia)  and one patient in the placebo group (who reported  worsening chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) did  not receive their assigned treatment. As of the data cut- off date, March 22, 2018, the median follow-up was  25·2 months (IQR 14·1–29·5). Patient characteristics,  including use of and response to previous chemo- radiotherapy treatment, were well balanced between  treatment groups.12 More than 79% of patients in the durvalumab group  and more than 82% of patients in the placebo group  completed questionnaires up to week 48 (appendix p 1).  There were no clinically relevant between-group  differences at baseline for any symptoms, function  scales, or global health status or quality of life (appendix  pp 2,3, and 8–10). Symptom scores were low overall: the  mean baseline key symptom scores with durvalumab  versus placebo were 35·7 (SD 26·7) versus 35·6 (27·7)  for cough, 22·3 (21·1) versus 20·6 (18·5) for dyspnoea,  15·3 (23·5) versus 16·4 (22·4) for chest pain, 32·6 (23·6)  versus 30·6 (21·2) for fatigue, and 19·1 (28·1) versus  20·5 (26·2) for appetite loss (appendix pp 8–10). For  physical function, the mean baseline scores with  durvalumab versus placebo were 79·5 (SD 18·9) and  81·0 (16·1). Finally, for global health status or quality of  life, mean baseline scores were 66·8 (SD 19·9) versus  68·0 (17·4; appendix pp 2,3, and 8–10). In the prespecified MMRM analysis of adjusted mean  change between baseline and 12 months (which we  averaged by visit over 12 months separately for the  durvalumab versus placebo groups), we found that  patient reports of cough (MMRM-adjusted mean  change 1·8 [95% CI 0·06 to 3·54] in the durvalumab  group vs 0·7 [–1·91 to 3·30] in the placebo group),  dyspnoea (3·1 [1·75 to 4·36] vs 1·4 [–0·51 to 3·34]),  and chest pain (–3·1  [–4·57  to –1·60] vs –3·5  [–5·68 to –1·29]; all assessed with QLQ-LC13); and  fatigue (–3·0 [–4·53 to –1·50] vs –5·2 [–7·45 to –2·98])  and appetite loss (–5·8 [–7·28 to –4·36] vs –7·0  [–9·17 to –4·87]; both assessed with QLQ-C30) remained  stable throughout the study for both durvalumab

and placebo (figure 2). Physical functioning (0·1  [–1·10 to 1·28] vs 2·0 [0·22 to 3·73]) and global health  status or quality of life (2·6 [1·21 to 3·94] vs 1·8  [–0·25 to 3·81]; both QLQ-C30) also remained stable  with both treatments throughout the study. We found  no difference between durvalumab and placebo on the  reported between-group differences  in  changes  from baseline to 12 months in cough (difference in  adjusted mean changes 1·1, 95% CI –1·89 to 4·11),  dyspnoea (1·6, –0·58 to 3·87), chest pain (0·4,  –2·13 to 2·93), fatigue (2·2, –0·38 to 4·78), appetite  loss (1·2, –1·27 to 3·67), physical functioning (–1·9,  –3·91 to 0·15), or global health status or quality of life  (0·8, –1·55 to 3·14). All absolute scores in PROs 
remained stable from baseline to week 48, with no  clinically relevant between-group differences, with the  exception of dysphagia and alopecia, for which there  were clinically relevant changes from baseline. Similar  improvements between baseline and week 48 were  observed for durvalumab and placebo: the mean  changes after treatment with durvalumab versus  placebo were –14·2 (SD 25·9) versus –15·7 (26·3) for  dysphagia and –23·2 (33·9) and –20·7 (28·9) for  alopecia (appendix pp 8–10). No clinically important between-group differences  were observed in prespecified analyses of time to  deterioration for most symptoms, functioning terms, or  global health status or quality of life (figure 3). However,  time to deterioration of other pain (ie, any pain other  than in the chest, arms, or shoulders) was longer in  patients receiving durvalumab than in those receiving  placebo. This between-group difference was not reflected  in any other pain terms (ie, QLQ-C30 pain, QLQ-LC13  chest pain, QLQ-LC13 arm or shoulder pain). We found no clinically important between-group  differences in the proportion of patients with clinically  relevant improvements in most symptoms (figure 4).  We also found no clinically important between-group  differences in the proportion of patients whose scores  improved for global health status or quality of life or  most functioning terms, except in emotional functioning  (which favoured durvalumab). In the prespecified exploratory analysis of health state  utility, the mean baseline EQ-5D index scores with  durvalumab versus placebo were 0·798 (SD 0·177) versus  0·803 (0·183). The mean changes in EQ-5D index score  between baseline and week 48 with durvalumab versus  placebo were –0·014 (SD 0·177) versus 0·012 (0·122).  The mean baseline EQ-VAS scores with durvalumab and  placebo were 74·3 (SD 16·8) and 74·8 (15·4). The mean  changes in the visual analogue score between baseline  and week 48 with durvalumab versus placebo were  2·1 (SD 16·5) versus 0·6 (11·9). We found no clinically  relevant changes19 from baseline in either score for either  treatment group. In a post-hoc analysis in which clinically relevant  deterioration had to be confirmed at the consecutive  timepoint after its first observation, time to deterioration  in nausea or vomiting, insomnia, constipation, overall  pain, chest pain, arm or shoulder pain, haemoptysis,  emotional functioning, and global health status or quality  of life were longer with durvalumab versus placebo  (appendix p 4). Time to deterioration in all other symptom  and functioning scales did not differ between groups.  Kaplan–Meier plots of time to deterioration for items  that differed notably between the prespecified and post- hoc analyses are presented in the appendix (pp 5–7). In a post-hoc comparison, baseline EORTC QLQ-C30  and EORTC QLQ-C13 data were mostly comparable with  baseline data from a reference group of 1262 unselected  patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (1046 patients

Discussion
We found that up to 12 months of durvalumab treatment  had no clinically  important detrimental effect on  symptoms, functioning, or global health status or quality  of life, which was comparable to placebo, further  supporting its benefit after concurrent chemo radio- therapy in patients with stage III, unresectable non- small-cell lung cancer. Notably, we observed no overall  worsening in key symptoms up to week 48. The only  symptoms that showed clinically meaningful changes  from baseline to week 48 were dysphagia and alopecia,  which improved with both durvalumab and placebo,  which probably reflects resolution of toxicities related to  previous concurrent chemoradiotherapy.20 The benefits of any treatment must be weighed against  the risks of detrimental effects through assessment of  the occurrence of adverse events and the effects of  treatment on PROs. However, evidence for the effect  of immuno-oncological treatment on PROs in patients  with unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer is  poor. Although use of durvalumab after concurrent  chemoradiotherapy was previously reported to be well  tolerated with a manageable safety profile, it is important  to evaluate the patient’s perspective and to show that  durvalumab does not result in worse PROs than placebo. Time to deterioration was generally similar between  treatment groups, apart from that of other pain (any  pain other than chest, arm, or shoulder pain), which  favoured durvalumab. However, the between-group  difference in other pain was not reflected in the other  QLQ-LC13 pain-related items and the QLQ-C30 overall  pain  item. Therefore,  the  favourable result  for  durvalumab regarding other pain should be interpreted  with caution. Notably, in an exploratory post-hoc  analysis in which clinically relevant deterioration was  required to be confirmed in the consecutive timepoint  after its first report, delays in worsening of overall pain  and  lung cancer-specific pain symptoms favoured  durvalumab. Further, delays in worsening were observed  for nausea or vomiting, constipation, insomnia, and  haemoptysis with durval umab relative to placebo. Of  note, when this confirmation of worsening at the next  consecutive timepoint was required, the number of  deterioration events reduced in more patients with  durvalumab  than with placebo, suggesting  the  possibility that transient changes in symptoms (ie, those  that might not have been associated with disease  progression) might have disproportionally affected the  durvalumab group.
The proportion of patients whose scores improved for  symptoms, functioning, and global health status or  quality of life were similar between treatment groups,  except for emotional functioning, which favoured  durvalumab. This finding might be associated with the  improved efficacy observed with durvalumab. These PRO data complement previously reported data  on the safety profile of durvalumab use after concurrent  chemoradiotherapy.13 Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were  comparable between durvalumab (30·5%) and placebo  (26·1%).13 Therefore, although the incidence of some  adverse events was greater with durvalumab versus  placebo (eg, cough, pneumonitis, or radiation pneu- monitis), these were low-grade events with no clinically  meaningful impairment to PROs (for instance, there  were no between-group differences in times to deter- ioration or the proportion of patients whose score  improved for dyspnoea in the QLQ-LC13).9 Overall,  analysis of  investigator-assessed adverse events  in  PACIFIC suggested a manageable safety profile.13 Patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer who  were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors have  shown stable or improved quality of life and a manageable  safety profile in other trials.21–24 The PRO data we report  are consistent with these observations. Improvement in quality of life is likely to be observed  with first-line and second-line anti-PD-1 drugs in stage IV  non-small-cell lung cancer; however, such improvement  in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer after chemoradio- therapy was not expected because of a lower symptom  burden and better baseline functioning. Furthermore,  patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer who  receive frequent surveillance imaging in the study  protocol would usually have a low symptom burden at the  time of radiological disease progression (although other  determinants of deterioration of quality of life besides  progression might contribute). Although durvalumab  significantly improved progression-free survival com- pared with placebo, it was not expected that patients’  quality of life would be affected. In PACIFIC, baseline  scores were low for symptoms and high for functioning  and global health status or quality of life when compared  with a historical reference group,17–19 possibly due to the  inclusion of patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung  cancer in the reference population. Nonetheless, this  finding indicates that patients with stage III locally  advanced disease with out disease progression after  concurrent chemoradiotherapy had satisfactory baseline  wellbeing. Thus, large improvements from baseline  were not anticipated and, notably, the addition of up to  12 months of durvalumab after concurrent chemo- radiotherapy did not compromise quality of life or have a  detrimental effect on quality of life in these patients with  earlier stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Additionally,  post-hoc exploratory analyses25 of patients from the  PACIFIC study found that tumour PD-L1 expression had  no clinically meaningful effect on PROs.

The PACIFIC study protocol was randomised, double- blind, and rigorous in design. The EORTC QLQ-C30 and  QLQ-LC13 questionnaires have been well validated in  previous studies.26 Developed in the chemotherapy era,  some items in these questionnaires might not be relevant  to immuno-oncology. However, research supports the  use of these measures in clinical non-small-cell lung  cancer contexts.27–29 Possible durvalumab-related symptoms that were not  captured by EORTC questionnaires include weight gain,  weight loss, poor ability to tolerate cold, feeling hot, rash,  and tremor.30 These are mainly symptoms that might  result from the reported treatment-related events of  hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, infusion-related  reaction, acute kidney injury, and tumour flares.30  However, we found no clinically important differences  between treatment groups in time to deterioration in  symptoms (in the QLQ-LC13 and QLQ-C30) and health- related quality of life, despite a longer treatment duration  in the durvalumab group compared with the placebo  group. This finding suggests that durvalumab treatment- related symptoms had no detrimental effect on patients’  health-related quality of life. Certain limitations of this analysis should be acknow- ledged. Since we randomly assigned patients to groups  up to 42 days after concurrent chemoradiotherapy,  these PRO data did not fully evaluate the patient  experience from time of diagnosis. However, this delay  is unlikely to have affected the results. PRO data were  only collected until disease progression, and time to  disease progression differed significantly between the  durvalumab and placebo groups. Therefore,  the  quantity of data differs between treatment groups,  potentially favouring placebo, given the potential for a  detrimental effect on PROs with longer exposure to  durvalumab. Moreover, these prespecified and post-hoc  analyses are exploratory and therefore lack formal  statistical testing for some outcomes. Prespecified  statistical analysis did not show clinically meaningful  differences in PROs between durvalumab and placebo  treatment. Finally, there is no gold standard regarding  the definition of time to deterioration, which can  depend on the compound’s mechanism of action,  disease stage, treatment line, or cancer type, and certain  PROs might be more susceptible to transient effects  than others (such as PROs with transient worsening  that resolves with intervention). In conclusion, our analyses of PROs showed that the  addition of up to 12 months of durvalumab treatment  did not compromise patients’ symptoms, functioning,  or global health status or quality of life during the  study period compared with placebo. These findings  complement the previously reported improvements in  progression-free survival and overall survival and  investigator-reported toxicity profile with durvalumab  and provide evidence to support the PACIFIC regimen  (durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy) as a 
new standard of care in unresectable, stage III non- small-cell lung cancer.
